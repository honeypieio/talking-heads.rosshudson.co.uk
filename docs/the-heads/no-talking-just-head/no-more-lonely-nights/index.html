  <h1>No More Lonely Nights</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Am   |F   |Am   |Dm   :|</p>

<p>Two love stories</p>

<p>She installed a video camera over her bed in the bedroom.
No more lonely nights. In a film she once saw, a girl was
fucked by a dog. So she went to the pet store - but felt
stupid - and came home with a goldfish in a plastic bag.
The fish&rsquo;s name is <code>SuperMan</code>. He would circle the bowl
world in five minutes.</p>

<p>|:Am    |G         :|
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights</p>

<p>|:Am   |F   |Am   |Dm   :|
This is two love stories</p>

<p>She goes to bed with a lipstick and a box of chocolate.
She read in a book once that chocolate was good both
in you and on you for sexual pleasure. SuperMan
watches glossy-eyed, camera staring mute, blinking
encouragingly down at the big bed where she has fallen
asleep, fingers smeared with &lsquo;Kissing Red&rsquo; and melted
chocolate - SuperMan and the remote control still in a
cramped grip.</p>

<p>|:Am    |G         :|
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights</p>

<p>|:Am   |F   |Am   |Dm   :|
Two love stories</p>

<p>For your birthday I&rsquo;ll give you scissors - shining, silver,
sharp! - to cut me open and step right in. You know I am
hot enough to keep you warm when winter comes. Oh, it
would suit you good, it would do you good. You can do
it, you&rsquo;ve done it before! Take my milky white and make
yourself a coat. Cut me open and step right in. I&rsquo;m sick of
being without you. Believe me, the pain means nothing.</p>

<p>|:Am    |G         :|
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights</p>

<p>|:Am   |F   |Am   |Dm   :|
Two love stories</p>

<p>Infected by your tongue when kissing, the I.V. love shock
that took me for a ride never ending. I guess I should have
known that needle&rsquo;d been around. The disease of loving
you spread fast through the blood. I lost everything I had
for you. I lost everything I was for you. I used to have a
language. I used to have a name. I used to have a name</p>

<p>|:Am    |G         :|
No more lonely nights&hellip; Now I have yours
No more lonely nights&hellip; Snakebite
No more lonely nights&hellip; Stabbing
No more lonely nights&hellip; Sex
I wanted to tell two love stories
One would be the story
The other
Would be the story
About love.</p>
