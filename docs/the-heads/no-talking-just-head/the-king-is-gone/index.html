  <h1>The King Is Gone</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:C#m   |   C#m6 C#m :|
|E      |F#     |
C#m                  C#m6 C#m
They came from the second city
                           C#m6 C#m
Where the screams came unattached
                    C#m6 C#m
Addiction was the latest style
       E    F#              C#m
In the faces they could not match
                          C#m6 C#m
There was a blue beat playing
                    C#m6 C#m
On the radio left behind
                             C#m6 C#m
And a man selling lies as truth
       E   F#                 C#m
Like a king who was loved too much</p>

<pre><code>                          C#m6 C#m
</code></pre>

<p>They made a mess of your only child
                         C#m6 C#m
Her innocence was not lost
                         C#m6 C#m
While the judge and jury took their dime
         E   F#             C#m
They counted the miles and laughed</p>

<p>|:C#m   |   C#m6 C#m :|</p>

<p>Make way for the way we are
The fever still burns though the king is gone</p>

<p>Fever comes to the innocent
It can make you mad and free
But you never find a scrap of love
       E          F#        C#m
If you don&rsquo;t wanna feel the heat</p>

<p>A million flames are lickin&rsquo;
They lie like dogs at your feet
Waitin&rsquo; for the words of wisdom
         E            F#           C#
From the mouths of the bittersweet</p>

<p>|:C#m   |   C#m6 C#m :|</p>

<p>In the valley of indiscretion
Where fear plays the piper&rsquo;s tune
The heroes are the ones who tell the truth
               E   F#                   C#m
And break the rules with the courage of love</p>

<p>|:C#m   |   C#m6 C#m :|
Make way for the way we are
E           F#     C#m
Fever still burns though the king is gone</p>

<p>Make way for the way we are
E           F#
The king is gone
C#m
But the fever lives on.</p>

  </pre>
