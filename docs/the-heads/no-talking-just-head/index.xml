      <description>|:Bm :| Come to me, babe, but come facing away Look back, you&amp;rsquo;ll see me, it&amp;rsquo;s a grownup at play. You might be pretty, but I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it before If that&amp;rsquo;s all you&amp;rsquo;ve got, I don&amp;rsquo;t need no more
|:F#m |A E |F#m :| Never mind never mind never mind never mind

      <description>Again a very basic song but oh so beautiful!!! Most of the song Am is being played. You can have the little riff that&amp;rsquo;s all the way through by playing the Am in the open version and by letting loose your forefinger&amp;hellip; In other words (tabs), repeat this: |&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;| |&amp;mdash;-101-| |-2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;| |-2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;| |&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;| |&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|
INTRO |:Bm :| |:Am :| Just a glimpse of thigh And the footlights of my burlesque season blaze across the sky And I&amp;rsquo;m tearin&amp;rsquo; back the red shift To tempt you with a shock of skin So milky white And the supernovas have their duller moments &amp;lsquo;Thought I&amp;rsquo;m fashionably late, I&amp;rsquo;m light years beyond them</description>

      <description>|:Am |F |Am |Dm :|
Two love stories
She installed a video camera over her bed in the bedroom. No more lonely nights. In a film she once saw, a girl was fucked by a dog. So she went to the pet store - but felt stupid - and came home with a goldfish in a plastic bag. The fish&amp;rsquo;s name is SuperMan. He would circle the bowl world in five minutes.</description>

      <description>|:Em Em6 Em7:| Pink confetti, shotgun wedding Rocket secrets someone&amp;rsquo;s shredding Nineteenth floor.
Laundry ticket that exploded Joust with Quaker pamphlet goaded Into war.
Ankle deep we heroes amble Ankel deep we wade Ankel deep through someone else&amp;rsquo;s Ticker tape parade
Am Softly, softly, softly Falls papersnow Softly, softly, softly All of our works blow away
|:Em Em6 Em7:| Petals fell on Petaluma Till-receipt from Montezuma&amp;rsquo;s Burger Hut.
Every day a billion dollars Fall as black and white blue-collars Plough their rut.</description>

      <description>NO TALKING JUST HEAD The Heads
The basis of this song is the Bbm chord. I&amp;rsquo;ve you&amp;rsquo;d like to give the song a different touch you might try to follow the baseline as well: |:Bbm Fm |D# C# :| although that&amp;rsquo;s not what they&amp;rsquo;re playing&amp;hellip;
|:Bbm :| Give &amp;lsquo;em no hope No tenderness No holiness No sensitivity No love No heart No imagination No compassion
No talking just head I cannot be dead I will be in your head You will be on your knees You&amp;rsquo;ll be beggin&amp;rsquo; me, &amp;lsquo;Please Make it fucking stop&amp;rsquo;!</description>
