<p>Am                 F              Am    F
There&rsquo;s buzzin&rsquo; and ringin&rsquo; in my ear
      Am                F       Am  F
And I wonder where do I go from here
    Am                  F
The moments missed, the tickin&rsquo; of time
Am                      F
I suppose this life is mine, all mine
Am                       F                   Am     F
I remember a time when my mind was clean and clear.</p>

<p>D         F                     D        F
How do I undo the damage I have done?
D         F                     D        F
How do I undo the damage I have done?
D         F                     D        F
How do I undo the damage I have done?
D         F                     D        F
How do I undo the damage I have done?</p>

<p>|:Am   |F   :|
I remember the color of your eyes changed from blue to black
My fingers twist in a fist behind your back
I crumbled and I cried
I look a long hard breath and died
I don&rsquo;t remember what I did
I don&rsquo;t remember what I said
I don&rsquo;t remember attackin&rsquo;.
If I could bend the bands of time, if I could reel it in
And in the mirror, who is that lookin&rsquo; back
And I&rsquo;m scared of whoever this is livin&rsquo; in my skin.</p>

<p>|:D   |F   :|
How do I undo the damage I have done?</p>

<p>How do I undo the damage I have done?</p>

<p>How do I undo the damage I have done?</p>

<p>How do I undo the damage I have done?</p>

<p>|:Am   |F   :|
I&rsquo;m sweatin&rsquo; with a pillow over my face
Thinkin&rsquo; back to exactly the time and place.
Darlin&rsquo;, it was all for you.
I believed all the things you said to me were true.
You know I love you to death, my dear, you know I do.</p>

<p>|:Am   |F   :|
How can I undo the damage I have done?
How do I undo the damage I have done?
How do I undo the damage I have done?
How do I undo the damage I have done?</p>
