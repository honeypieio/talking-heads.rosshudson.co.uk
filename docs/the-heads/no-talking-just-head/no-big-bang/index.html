  <h1>No Big Bang</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>Again a very basic song but oh so beautiful!!!
Most of the song Am is being played. You can have the little
riff that&rsquo;s all the way through by playing the Am in the open
version and by letting loose your forefinger&hellip;
In other words (tabs), repeat this:
|&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;|
|&mdash;-101-|
|-2&mdash;&mdash;|
|-2&mdash;&mdash;|
|&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;|
|&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;|</p>

<p>INTRO |:Bm   :|
|:Am   :|
Just a glimpse of thigh
And the footlights of my burlesque season
        blaze across the sky
And I&rsquo;m tearin&rsquo; back the red shift
To tempt you with a shock of skin
So milky white
And the supernovas have their duller moments
&lsquo;Thought I&rsquo;m fashionably late, I&rsquo;m light years beyond them</p>

<p>You grow thirsty
And I&rsquo;m all spread out, hung high and flirty,
        reflected on the shore
And you dive, dive, dive in
Painting ripples on my skin
So blue and warm
When the supernovas have their duller moments
&lsquo;Though I&rsquo;m fashionably late, I&rsquo;m light years beyond them</p>

<p>BREAK: |:G   |    |Em   |   :|</p>

<p>No big bang of a man, bang of a man
No big bang of a man, bang of a man is enough to -</p>

<p>|:Am   :|
I watch you sleep
I&rsquo;ve been on the prowl forever,
        there&rsquo;s no shade from my beam
And I&rsquo;ll suck you up with my weather
Lock you in a silver tether
Drown you in cream
Even supernovas have their duller moments
No big bang of a man is enough to fill them</p>

<p>Even supernovas have their quiet moments
No big bang of a man is enough to fill them
When I&rsquo;m lost out there
I am everywhere
And I&rsquo;m lost out there
No big bang of a man is enough
No big bang of a man is enough
No big bang of a man is enough to fill them.
No big bang of a man is enough to fill them.</p>
