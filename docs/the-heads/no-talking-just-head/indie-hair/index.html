  <pre>
    <p>|:D   |     |Bm   |    :|</p>

<p>D           Bm
I had a job washin&rsquo; dishes in a sink
D                         Bm
It made me rich, but in a different kind of way.
F       G      D    F       G         D
I could cut my hair, but it costs too much.
F       G          D                  F      G        D
So I&rsquo;ll buy my own clippers, darlin&rsquo;, and D.I.Y. this bush!</p>

<p>|:D   |     |Bm   |    :|
Her last temptation was to grab that beggin&rsquo; bowl.
Her belly was empty, but her mind was full.
Can you see it?
Would you go?
F       G      D    F         G         D
I could cut your hair, but it costs too much
F       G          D                  F      G        D
So I&rsquo;ll buy my own clippers, darlin&rsquo;, and D.I.Y. this bush!</p>

<p>|:E   :|
|A
          Bm         D
Would you go with me anywhere? Hummm -
        Bm                                 F   G   D
I can&rsquo;t sing, I can&rsquo;t bring this peace without you here</p>

<p>|:D   |     |Bm   |    :|
They say he left his home with only five strands
Are you okay? You&rsquo;ve got your head in my hands
F         G       D
Would you go with me?
F         G       D
Could you sing a song?
F    G                        D
I&rsquo;ve brought my own clippers, darlin&rsquo;
F   G       D
It won&rsquo;t be long.</p>

<p>|:Bm   :|
We&rsquo;re going to India to sit with angels.
We&rsquo;re going to India to sit with devils.
We&rsquo;re going to India to sit with angels.
We&rsquo;re going to India to sit with devils.</p>
