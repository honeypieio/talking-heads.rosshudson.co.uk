So if you need a new direction
        in the way you think and feel
You let me know, now, I no know!

Don&rsquo;t take my kindness for weakness
Bm                                    G  A
When I&rsquo;m on to every one of your secrets
Bm                                     G    A
And the way you treat a brain, I don&rsquo;t need this
Bm                                       G  A
Where everything gets fixed in the one hit
Bm                               G  A
And I say that game is show biz

Don&rsquo;t take my kindness for weakness
When I&rsquo;m into every one of your secrets
And the way you treat a brain, I don&rsquo;t need this
Everything is fixed in a slow kiss!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need to see you standin&rsquo; there
I don&rsquo;t need to beware
I don&rsquo;t care, I don&rsquo;t care
I don&rsquo;t care&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, everything is fixed in the one hit
And I&rsquo;ll say it once again, that is show biz!</p>

Will you rock?
We rock.
Do you rock?
Oh, rock!
We rock.
Oh, rock
We rock.</p>

<p>|:Bm        |           |         |G  A   :|
Don&rsquo;t take my kindness for weakness
When I&rsquo;m on to every one of your secrets
When everything is fixed in the one hit
When I have to put up with your bullshit!
Just because I do not keep my mouth shut
Doesn&rsquo;t not mean I am a blood clot!</p>

<p>|:Em   |C   :|
Rock me, lady!
Tell me, baby!
Sleazy lady!
You&rsquo;re with me lady!
It&rsquo;s easy, baby!
Tell me, lady!
You drive me crazy!
You&rsquo;re with me, baby!
Sleazy lady!
You&rsquo;re on it, you&rsquo;re on it, you&rsquo;re on it, you&rsquo;re on it now&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a plant life in our one-and-only world&hellip;
It&rsquo;s a plant life&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been planted and I won&rsquo;t dance&hellip;</p>
