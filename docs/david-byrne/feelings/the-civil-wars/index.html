  <h1>The Civil Wars</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>G                   A
I got a right to be out on my mind
G                   A
I got a right to be who I am
G        A
Love me, love my problems
G              A
The good times and the rotten</p>

<p>A                                D
The war is in me, the war is in you
F
The war is in everybody now
F#m        E     B              |A   |    |
Shake this tone, out of control</p>

<p>G                      A
They are fightin&rsquo; with knives and forks
G                    A
Demonstrating how democracy works
G              A
God&rsquo;s good and God is great
G            A
So I wear my happy face</p>

<p>A                                D
The war is in you, the war is in me
F
The war is in everybody now
F#m         E      B
The wolf is loose, he&rsquo;s living in you
G#m         E
There&rsquo;ll be a celebration
G#m          E        C#m
Johnny comes marching home
G#m      E
His eyes are on the ceiling
G#m         E       C#m
It ain&rsquo;t no fashion show
G#m         E
A heavy situation
G#m         E       C#m
Does things to your skin
G#m      E
Although it ain&rsquo;t no party
             C#m
Dying to get in</p>

<p>|B   |     |
|:G   |A   :|
Sex is something if it&rsquo;s looking good
A ceasefire in the neighbourhood
We bleed and stain the carpet
We start our own republic</p>

<p>A            A G                D
The war is in me, the war is in you
F
The war is in everybody now
F#m            E
The greatest look
   B             |A   |    |
In heaven above
|:G#m  |E   :|
There&rsquo;ll be a celebration
                      C#m
Johnny comes marching home
|:G#m  |E   :|
His eyes are on the ceiling
                    C#m
It ain&rsquo;t no fashion show
|:G#m  |E   :|
A heavy situation
                    C#m
Does things to your skin
|:G#m  |E   :|
Although it ain&rsquo;t no party
             C#m
Dying to get in</p>
