  <h1>They Are In Love</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:E    |C   |C#m   |C   :|
E                       C
She put the scar on the side of his face
     C#m                      A
When he disappeared for three days
    B              A           E
And they said that they are in love</p>

<p>E                        C
He took her cocaine when she was asleep
C#m                       A
Friends say he gave half away
    B              A           E
And they said that they are in love</p>

<pre><code>  B         E
</code></pre>

<p>Run away, run away
      B     C             B
Run away, before it&rsquo;s too late</p>

<pre><code>     C#                       C#m    Cm
</code></pre>

<p>There is danger but they will not see
           C#m             Cm          B            E
If they&rsquo;re blind then it&rsquo;s blind that they&rsquo;d rather be</p>

<p>E                               C
This town&rsquo;s destroyed more than one friend of mine
C#m               A
Funny, they never leave
     B        A           E
They say that they are in love</p>

<p>E                     C
Some say it&rsquo;s right, some say it&rsquo;s wrong
C#m                     A
Some say it&rsquo;s hard to believe
    B             A           E
And some say that they are in love</p>

<pre><code>  B          E
</code></pre>

<p>Move away, move away
      B     C             B
Move away before it&rsquo;s too late</p>

<pre><code>     C#                   C#m   Cm
</code></pre>

<p>Then the lion sleeps with the lamb
      C#m          Cm         B        E
Only love let&rsquo;s me forget who I really am
|C#m   |Cm   |B   |E   |   |
|E   |C   |C#m   |A   |B   |A   |E   |</p>

<p>E                        C
This land is small, it&rsquo;s cold and it&rsquo;s damp
C#m                              A
There&rsquo;s no place that I&rsquo;d rather be
    B       A       E
I know that I am in love</p>

<p>E                 C
Ethnic divisions, screaming demands
C#m                       A
A little bit like you and me
   B         A         E
I guess that we are in love</p>

<pre><code>  B          E
</code></pre>

<p>Stay away, stay away
      B              C           B
Stay away, you might end up like me
         C#                  C#m  Cm
It&rsquo;s the pain that keeps us alive
         C#m       Cm           B         E
But that beauty is all that we need to survive
         C#m       Cm           B         E
That damn beauty is all that we need to survive</p>
