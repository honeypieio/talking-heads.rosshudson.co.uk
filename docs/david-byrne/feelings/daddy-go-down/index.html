  <h1>Daddy Go Down</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Gm   :|
The sun sinks low in the western lands
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
And a woman&rsquo;s heart is like the wind
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down</p>

<p>And he could not put her from his mind
And love is strong and it will not die
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down</p>

<p>Protect me now from what I am
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
For I&rsquo;m in too deep and I cannot swim
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down</p>

<p>And he cursed his hands and he cursed his tongue
For what he&rsquo;d said, for what he&rsquo;d done
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down</p>

<p>|:B   :|
Love, love, love&rsquo;s obsession
What keeps a man alive
By some strange possession
I stay safe inside
My heart&rsquo;s on probation
It was my first time
In this world, world of wonders
Stick your head outside  |D   |</p>

<p>|:Gm   :|
Now the ass can speak but he don&rsquo;t say much
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
His words of wisdom, come but once
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down</p>

<p>So build your house on solid ground
And stay indoors when the rain comes down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down</p>

  </pre>
