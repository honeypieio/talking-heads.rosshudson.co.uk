  <h1>What A Day That Was</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:E    :|
Well, I&rsquo;m dressed up so nice
An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; my best
Yes I&rsquo;m startin&rsquo; over..
Startin&rsquo; over in another place</p>

<p>|:G   :|
Lemme tell you a story
Big chief with a golden crown
He&rsquo;s got rings on his finger
And then he walks up, up to the throne</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; shapes with his hands
An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t choo dare sit down
Now don&rsquo;t choo dare jump back
And don&rsquo;t choo dare stick out!</p>

<pre><code>       D                 C
</code></pre>

<p>And on the first day, we had everything we could hold
  G                      D
  Ooh and then we let if all
                                 C
And on the second day, there was nothing else left to do
  G                   D
  Ooh what a day that was.</p>

<p>|:E   :|
There are 50,000 beggars
Roaming in the streets
They have lost all their possessions
They have nothing left to eat</p>

<p>|:G   :|
Down come a bolt of lightning
Now an electrical storm
Starts a chain reaction
Go pull a fire alarm</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m dreaming of a city
It was my own invention
And I put the wheels in motion
A time for big decisions</p>

<pre><code>       D                  C
</code></pre>

<p>And on the first day, we had everything we could hold
  G                      D
  Ooh and then we let if all
           D                     C
And on the second day, there was nothing else left to do
  G                   D
  Ooh what a day that was.</p>

<p>Bb            G
Oh a day that was
Bb                    G
Ooh that&rsquo;s the way it goes
Bb                     D#             F
There&rsquo;s a million ways- to get things done
Bb                     D#              F      E
Three&rsquo;s a million ways- to make things work out.</p>

<p>|:E    :|
Well I&rsquo;m going right trough
And the light came down
Well they&rsquo;re roundin&rsquo; &lsquo;em up
from all over town
|:G   :|
They&rsquo;re movin&rsquo; forward and back
They&rsquo;re movin&rsquo; backwards and front
And they&rsquo;re enjoying themselves
Moving in ev&rsquo;ry direction</p>

<p>So if you feel like you&rsquo;re in a whirlpool
You feel like going home
And if you feel like talking to someone
Who know the difference between right and wrong</p>

<pre><code>       D                  C

<p>And on the first day, we had everything we could hold
  G                      D
  Ooh and then we let if all
           D                     C
And on the second day, there was nothing else left to do
  G                      D
  Ooh what a day that was.
|:E   :|</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re go(in&rsquo;) boom boom boom   That&rsquo;s the way we live
And in a great big room and That&rsquo;s the way we live.</p>
