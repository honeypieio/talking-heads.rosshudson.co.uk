Bm
Caught you walking&rsquo; like a gangster
A                       Bm
Saw you grabbin&rsquo; the controls
Now you&rsquo;re almost outta batteries
A                         Bm
You gotta sweater much to small
Bm6           Bm
Pokin&rsquo; at your navel
Bm6           Bm
Pointin&rsquo; your finger too
C#6
You say your lips don&rsquo;t even stick together
         E          Bm
When the dust comes up
Bm6                Bm
Blowin&rsquo; &lsquo;cross the plains
C#6<br />
Pictures fallin&rsquo; in and outta their frames!</p>

<p>Bm
Good and evil, good and evil
A                           Bm
They turned &lsquo;em loose, they turned into people
Good and evil, good and evil
A                           Bm
They turned &lsquo;em loose, they turned into people
              F#
You know that roses and lilacs are funky too?
Bm
Let &lsquo;em go at it, let&rsquo;s see what they do
F#
Now we&rsquo;re wrestlin&rsquo; with the forces of good and evil
Bm
They turned &lsquo;em loose, they turned into people</p>

<p>|:Bm   |Bm   |A   |Bm   :|
Bm
I have seen you do thing backward
A                          Bm
You don&rsquo;t believe a word I say
Now you&rsquo;re holdin&rsquo; sticky paper
A                 Bm
Money never fades away</p>

<p>Bm6            Bm
Talkin&rsquo; like a monster
Bm6             Bm
Smellin&rsquo; like a baby
C#m6
You got a head like a bowl full of cherries
E               Bm
Now don&rsquo;t be surprised
Bm6
You go what it takes
C#m6
Messin&rsquo; round like monkeys and apes</p>

<p>Bm
Good and evil, good and evil
A                           Bm
They turned &lsquo;em loose, they turned into people

A                           Bm
They turned &lsquo;em loose, they turned into people
              F#
You know that roses and lilacs are funky too?
Bm
Let &lsquo;em go at it, let&rsquo;s see what they do
F#<br />
Now we&rsquo;re wrestlin&rsquo; with the forces of good and evil
