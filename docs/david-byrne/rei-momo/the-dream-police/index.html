F
Combing the snakes in his head
Reading a book in his bed
C
Getting ready for the night to begin
                        F
Waiting for daylight to end</p>

<p>F
In this court of law
This court of common pleas
C
The crimes that you committed
                      F
You claim were only a dream</p>

<p>F
Ev&rsquo;ryone has the same dreams
On diff&rsquo;rent days of the week
C
We are the watchdogs of your mind
                    F
We are the dream police</p>

The judge has closed his eyes
The court begins to dream
Of  crimes that you committed
While you were lying asleep</p>

<p>Ev&rsquo;reyone has the same dreams
On diff&rsquo;rent days of the week
We are the watchdogs of your mind
We are the dream police</p>

<p>Combing the snakes in his head
Reading a book in his bed

Getting ready for the night to begin
                        F
Waiting for daylight to end

Getting ready for the night to begin

Waiting for daylight to end</p>
