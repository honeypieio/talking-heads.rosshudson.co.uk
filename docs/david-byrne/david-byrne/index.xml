      <description>The basis of this song are Em(+7) and Am(+7) on the fifth fret. Byrne is picking the guitar like this:
Em(+7) Am(+7) |&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;30&amp;mdash;-|&amp;ndash;30&amp;mdash;-|&amp;ndash;30&amp;mdash;-|&amp;ndash;30&amp;mdash;- |&amp;ndash;30&amp;mdash;-|&amp;ndash;30&amp;mdash;-|&amp;ndash;30&amp;mdash;-|&amp;ndash;30&amp;mdash;-|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash; |&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|-2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;|-2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;|-2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;|-2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash; |-0&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;|-0&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;|-0&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;|-0&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;|2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-|2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-|2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-|2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- |2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-|2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-|2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-|2&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash; |&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;
Em7 we&amp;rsquo;re living in a dump trying to figure out what sex we are Am7 exchanging chromosomes trying to bargain for a better future Em7 well i&amp;rsquo;ll trade you my potential mental illness for your bad teeth Am7 how &amp;lsquo;bout trading your sexy body for a full head of hair Em7 well we can&amp;rsquo;t predict the future but we&amp;rsquo;re trying to to the best that we can Am7 my cards are on the table i&amp;rsquo;m gambling everything that i am Em7 and some of us are hoping to end up with a perfect life Am7 i&amp;rsquo;ll trade you everything that i got for the chance to be someone else Em7 and what you see is what you get and what you get is what you choose Am7 and what i am what you see is exactly what i chose to be</description>

      <description>|:E |A |B :| (all song through)
Running naked, down the state highway runnin&amp;rsquo; naked, in the middle of the day runnin&amp;rsquo; naked like a Tom Cat&amp;rsquo;s behind runnin&amp;rsquo; naked but the cat don&amp;rsquo;t seem to mind
Give me your heart I&amp;rsquo;ll give you mine first give me your time I&amp;rsquo;ll give you my trust
(and we&amp;rsquo;re) buck naked now like when we were born when will we find out? why does it take so long?</description>

      <description>(This song is either more complicated than it looks like or much more simple than it sounds. There&amp;rsquo;s this basis of Gm and Dm that are played real short or are just not being played at all. Try to do some improvising!!!)

Gm Dm momma she had complications Gm Dm there&amp;rsquo;s nothing very strange about that Gm Dm nuns said &amp;ldquo;we can&amp;rsquo;t kill that baby Gm Dm we&amp;rsquo;ll have to let the mother die&amp;rdquo;</description>
