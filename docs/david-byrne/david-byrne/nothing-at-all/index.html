  <h1>Nothing At All</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:G  F#  |E   :|
lord knows we&rsquo;ve become scientific
it&rsquo;s nothing special at all
sometimes everything gets big and nothing is small
we can live here every day
we can be here whenever we play</p>

<p>A          D                A
   and the knife is near at hand
      D                   A
i cut myself to see who i am
        D
reach inside, but i still can&rsquo;t
F#                     E
touch the policeman inside</p>

<p>|:G  F#  |E   :|
baby jesus, holy moses!
he can stop on a dime
i guess there&rsquo;s just too many supposes
for me to put out that fire
skin so soft&hellip; feels so &hellip; light
guess i&rsquo;ll stay at home tonight
A            D                 A
   from the rockies to the rio grande
A         D                       A
a big ol&rsquo;shadow falls across the land
A         D
had some money, but it&rsquo;s not
  F#                 E
enough to keep me in line
|:G    |C   :|
G                 C
we made love in a shower of stars
G                 C
i had a vision in my backyard
G                 C
saw a car drive across the sky
G                                  C
behind the wheel, look there, it&rsquo;s you and i
                 G                  C
looks like we&rsquo;re gonna get outta ourselves tonight</p>

<p>looks like-
|:G  F#  |E   :|
what do you suppose?
was it nothing at all?
what do you suppose?
was it nothing at all?
those good times, good times,
good times we had
were they nothing at all?
did i sleep a little too late?
or am i awake?
shake your body till the fear is gone
like it was nothing at all
it&rsquo;s so easy, so easy
hey, it&rsquo;s nothing at all
so easy, so easy, so easy
hey it&rsquo;s nothing at all</p>

  </pre>
