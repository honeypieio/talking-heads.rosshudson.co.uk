  <h1>A Self-Made Man</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>The basis of this song are Em(+7) and Am(+7) on the fifth fret.
Byrne is picking the guitar like this:</p>

<p>Em(+7)                               Am(+7)

<p>Em7
we&rsquo;re living in a dump
trying to figure out what sex we are
Am7
exchanging chromosomes
trying to bargain for a better future
          Em7
well i&rsquo;ll trade you my potential mental illness
for your bad teeth
Am7
how &lsquo;bout trading your sexy body for a full head of hair
        Em7
well we can&rsquo;t predict the future
but we&rsquo;re trying to to the best that we can
Am7
my cards are on the table i&rsquo;m gambling everything that i am
Em7
and some of us are hoping
to end up with a perfect life
Am7
i&rsquo;ll trade you everything that i got
for the chance to be someone else
Em7
and what you see is what you get
and what you get is what you choose
Am7
and what i am
what you see
is exactly what i chose to be</p>

C#m              E
and now we got a black market
   C#m               E
a market in designer genes
C#m                 E                C#m                   E
the most beautiful, most intelligent criminals you&rsquo;ve ever seen
    C#M               E
and now you&rsquo;re paying top dollar
    C#m                      E
for what you used to get for free
        C#m                       E
they&rsquo;ll stun you with their looks
    C#m                       E<br />
and charm you with effortless ease</p>

<pre><code>          C#m                E
</code></pre>

<p>they&rsquo;ve taken everything from you
the way that you walk
C#m
the way that you smile
    E
the sound of your voice
           C#m  E
don&rsquo;t even know who you are
C#m
who are you now?
E
who are you now?</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m a self made man, i&rsquo;m a self-made man
      Bm        E          Bm        E
i&rsquo;m a self-made man (i&rsquo;ve got nothing left to give)
      Bm        E          Bm        E
i&rsquo;m a self-made man (i&rsquo;ve got nothing left to lose)</p>
