  <h1>Lilies of the Valley</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>(This song is either more complicated than it looks like or much
more simple than it sounds. There&rsquo;s this basis of Gm and Dm that
are played real short or are just not being played at all. Try to
do some improvising!!!)</p>

<p>|:Gm   |Dm   :|</p>

<p>Gm                  Dm
momma she had complications
Gm                                 Dm
there&rsquo;s nothing very strange about that
Gm                            Dm
nuns said &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t kill that baby
Gm                           Dm
we&rsquo;ll have to let the mother die&rdquo;</p>

<p>Am                            Dm
we are all just lilies of the valley
                    Bb A
we neither reap nor sow
Dm
we need to get our hands a little dirty
                          Bb A
to make our gardens grow, hey hey</p>

<p>|:Gm   |Dm   :|
Gm                          Dm
way too many people on this island
Gm                              Dm
getting way too crowded on this boat
Gm                        Dm
need someone to bail some water
Gm                             Dm
if we&rsquo;re gonna keep this thing afloat</p>

<p>Dm
i like a little sugar in my coffee
                        A Bb
i don&rsquo;t mean sweet &lsquo;n&rsquo; low
Dm
you don&rsquo;t know what you want until you find it
                          Bb A
i believe you&rsquo;ll tell me so</p>

<p>|:Gm   |Dm   :|4x
Gm                          Dm
i need a little water in my garden
Gm                             Dm
i need a little sunlight on my heads
Gm                              Dm
i need someone to cover me with kisses
Gm                     Dm
when i&rsquo;m all alone and scared</p>

<p>Dm
we are all just lilies of the valley
                      Bb A
we neither reap nor sow
Dm<br />
we need to get our hands a little dirty
                        Bb A
to make our gardens grow</p>

<p>|:Gm   |Dm   :|</p>
