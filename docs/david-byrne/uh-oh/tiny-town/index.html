  <h1>Tiny Town</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Bbmaj7  |    A:|
It&rsquo;s a tiny town, you cabn hang around with me
It&rsquo;s a tiny town, and everybody knows what you&rsquo;ve been doing
So don&rsquo;t you mess around, it&rsquo;s a tiny town
teeny weeny town, tiny town
And every little town, if you look around
it&rsquo;s a tiny town, tiny town</p>

<p>F             Em       F                G
Be careful my darling, what you say and do
    F             Em                       F    A
the shit that you make comes right back to you</p>

<pre><code>    E          A          D          E       A    E
</code></pre>

<p>And the whole wide world is a tiny town, full of tiny ideas
          E    A             D<br />
with each tiny heart pumping up and down
E       A         E
Come be tiny with me</p>

<p>|:Bbmaj7  |A   :|
In such a tiny town, we have trouble living with each other
Someone would knock you down and someone else would like to steal your lover
Mmm, such a tiny town, it&rsquo;s enough to make you loose your mind
Mother nature said, she won&rsquo;t play that way so quit your crying</p>

<p>F          Em         F              G
Mama still loves you, when you go astray
F                 Em                F    A
You don&rsquo;t need to push her in her grave</p>

<pre><code>  E     A           D           E        A      D
</code></pre>

<p>In my tiny mind you are tiny too and I&rsquo;ll be tiny tonight
         E    A       D        E           A         E<br />
For each tiny me is a tiny you, close your tiny town eyes</p>

<p>G                  D    G                      D<br />
And the birds sweatly singing in the tiny town trees
Bb     A        E                 G    Bb                   E
And the animals ask what you&rsquo;re doing, it&rsquo;s as plain as can be</p>

<p>INSTR:  |:Bbmaj7    |A    :|</p>

<p>F          Em            F            G
I see your sadness, like birds in the air
F          Em          F     A
I see them all flying away</p>

<pre><code>    E    A             D          E    A    D
</code></pre>

<p>In each tiny heart in this tiny world is a tiny desire
         E    A            D          E          D         E
And each tiny boy and each tiny girl close their tiny town eyes
        E          A          D          E       D     E
And the whole wide world is a tiny town, full of tiny ideas
          E      A            D            E       D         E
with each tiny hearts pumping up and down, come be tiny with me</p>

<p>(this is what I think David Byrne is playing more or less.
Note that the original is played with a capo on the second fret.
I put the Bbmaj7 chord down here because I don&rsquo;t know the name of
the real thing:</p>
