  <h1>Twistin&#39; in the Wind</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:A   :|
A          G    A     G
Now Washington, D.C.
     A     G      A     G
Is a funny little town
    A       G        A    G
The further you look into it
    A       G            A
The further things stick out</p>

<p>|:A   G  :|
You oughta be ashamed
You oughta be destroyed
I&rsquo;ll chop you into little bits
And feed you to my dogs</p>

<p>|:A   E  :|
Well well well well well
What have we got here?
What have we got now?
Hey hey hey hey hey
Twistin&rsquo; in the wind
Twistin&rsquo; all night long</p>

<p>|:C  G  :|
Now can you picture this?
A taste of what will be
The weatherman is wrong again
It looks like rain to me</p>

<p>I heard the whistle blow
The train has jumped the track
The mighty engine&rsquo;s outa gas
Bureaucratic heart attack</p>

<p>|:A  G  :|
My sister likes the boys
They kinda like her, too
My mama says, &ldquo;Be careful&rdquo;
Sister says, &ldquo;No, that ain&rsquo;t cool&rdquo;</p>

<p>My daddy fell in love
Down at the factory
And me, I like to sit around
Get high, and watch T.V.</p>

<p>|:E  A  :|
Well well well well well
What have we got here?
What have we got now?
Hey hey hey hey hey
Twistin&rsquo; in the wind
Twistin&rsquo; all night long</p>

<p>Now I can take a joke
I&rsquo;m laughin&rsquo; at myself
I faked my way through college
And I faked my way through sex</p>

<p>|:C  G  :|
I&rsquo;ve been falling down too long
I&rsquo;ve been bangin&rsquo; up my head
And if I could stay on my feet
I&rsquo;d prob&rsquo;ly go right back again</p>

<p>|:A    :|
|:A  G  :|
Now Harry&rsquo;s got a gun
And he just turned fourteen
He dresses like a gangster
But he&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; on the street</p>

<p>They kicked him in the balls
They shaved off all his hair
They put a current through his head
And left him lyin&rsquo; there</p>

<p>|:A  E  :|
Well well well well well
What have we got here?
What have we got now?
Hey hey hey hey hey
Twistin&rsquo; in the wind
Twistin&rsquo; all night long</p>

<p>|:C  G  :|
They say that crime don&rsquo;t pay
The judge does not agree
&lsquo;Cause if you got the money
He will surely set you free</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll watch you burn in hell
I&rsquo;ll see you in your grave
I&rsquo;d like to watch you suffer for
The evil that you made</p>

<p>|:A   :|
|:A  G  :|
Hi-dee hi-dee ho
What a funny clown
The fat man he fell off the wall
And he can&rsquo;t get up again</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to say goodbye
It&rsquo;s time to say goodnight
Whoever is the last one out
Well, please turn out the light</p>
