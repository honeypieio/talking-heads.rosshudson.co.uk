      <description>Writing down the chords of Born under Punches seems to be a little strange since there&amp;rsquo;s actualy only one basic riff being played. But I was asked to do it anyhow, so here it is:
|:Gm7 Gm7(+9):|

      <description>The story about Remain in light is almost getting a little boring: Crosseyed and Painless exists again of just one or two chords! Two guitars are playing Bm7: one on the second fret, the other on the seventh.
(First guitar) Bm7 ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-
