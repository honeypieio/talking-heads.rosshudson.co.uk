  <h1>Seen And Not Seen</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Em   :|</p>

<p>He would see faces in movies, on T.V., in magazines, and in books&hellip;.
|D   |:Em   |D   :|
He thought that some of these faces might be right for him&hellip;.And
through the years, by keeing an ideal facial structure fixed in his
mind&hellip;.Or somewhere in the back of his mind&hellip;.That he might, by
force of will, cause his face to approach those of his ideal..</p>

<p>|:D   :|
..The change would be very subtle&hellip;.It might take ten years or so&hellip;.</p>

<p>|D    |:Em   |D   :|
Gradually his face would change its&rsquo; shape&hellip;.A more hooked nose&hellip;
Wider, thinner lips&hellip;.
|D:    |G    :|
Beady eyes&hellip;.A larger forehead.</p>

<p>|D    |:Em   |D   :|</p>

<p>He imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other
people&hellip;.They had also molded their faced according to some
ideal&hellip;.Maybe they imagined that their new face would better
suit their personality&hellip;.Or maybe they imagined
|D:    |G     :|
that their personality would be forced to change to fit the new
appearance&hellip;.This is why first impressions are often correct&hellip;
|D    |:Em   |D   :|
Although some people might have made mistakes&hellip;.They may have
arrived at an appearance that bears no relationship to them&hellip;.
They may have picked an ideal appearance based on some childish
whim, or momentary impulse..
|D:    |G     |Em    |G   :|
..Some may have gotten half-way there, and then changed their minds.
|D    |:Em   |D   :|
He wonders if he too might have made a similar mistake.</p>
