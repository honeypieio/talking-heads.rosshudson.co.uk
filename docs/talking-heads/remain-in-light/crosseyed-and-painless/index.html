  <h1>Crosseyed &amp; Painless</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>The story about Remain in light is almost getting a little boring:
Crosseyed and Painless exists again of just one or two chords!
Two guitars are playing Bm7: one on the second fret,
the other on the seventh.</p>

<p>(First guitar)
Bm7

<p>|:Bm7   Bm7+6:|</p>

<p>(Second guitar)
|:A Bm      :|</p>

<p>Lost my shape-Trying to act casual!
Can&rsquo;t stop-I might end up in the hospital
I&rsquo;m changing my shape-I feel like an accident
They&rsquo;re back!-To explain their experience</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it weird/Looks too obscure to me
Wasting away/And that was their policy</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m ready to leave-I push the fact in front of me
Facts lost-Facts are never what they seem to be
Nothing there!-No information left of any kind
Lifting my head-Looking for danger signs</p>

<p>There was a line/There was a formula
Sharp as a knife/Facts cut a hole in us
There was a line/There was a formula
Sharp as a knife/Facts cut a hole in us</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;
I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;
I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;
The feeling returns/Whenever we close out eyes
Lifting my head/looking around inside</p>

<p>The island of doubt-It&rsquo;s like the taste of medicine
Working by hindsight-Got the message from the oxygen
Making a list-Find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right-Facts are useless in emergencies</p>

<p>The feeling returns/Whenever we close out eyes
Lifting my head/Looking around inside.</p>

<p>Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are late
Facts all come with points of view
Facts don&rsquo;t do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of things
Facts don&rsquo;t stain the furniture
Facts go out and slam the door
Facts are written all over your face
Facts continue to change their shape</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;
I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;
I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;I&rsquo;m still waiting&hellip;</p>
