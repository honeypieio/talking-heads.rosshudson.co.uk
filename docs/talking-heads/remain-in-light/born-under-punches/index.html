  <h1>Born Under Punches</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>Writing down the chords of Born under Punches seems to be a little
strange since there&rsquo;s actualy only one basic riff being played.
But I was asked to do it anyhow, so here it is:</p>

<p>|:Gm7   Gm7(+9):|</p>

<p>Gm7
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>

<p>Gm7(+9)
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
||&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&ndash;x&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>

<p>Take a look at these hands.
Take a look at these hands.
The hand speaks. The hand of a government man.
Well I&rsquo;m a tumbler. Born under punches.
I&rsquo;m so thin.</p>

<p>All I want is to breathe I&rsquo;m too thin
Won&rsquo;t you breathe with me?
Find a little space, so we can move in-between In-Between it
And keep on step ahead, of yourself.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you miss it, don&rsquo;t you miss it.
Some &lsquo;a you people just about missed it!
Last time to make plans!
Well I&rsquo;m a tumbler&hellip;
I&rsquo;m a Government Man.</p>

<p>Never seen anything like that before
Falling bodies tuble &lsquo;cross the floor Well I&rsquo;m a tumbler!
When you get to where you wanna be Thank you! Thank you!
When you get to where you wanna be Don&rsquo;t even mention it!</p>

<p>Take a look at these hands. They&rsquo;re passing in-between us.
Take a look at these hands
Take a look at these hands. You don&rsquo;t have to mention it.
No thanks. I&rsquo;m a Government Man.</p>

<p>And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;
And the heat goes on&hellip;Where the hand has been&hellip;And the heat goes
on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes
on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes
on&hellip;Where the hand has been&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat
goes on&hellip;
I&rsquo;m not a drowning man!
And I&rsquo;m not a burning building! (I&rsquo;m a tumbler!)
Drowning cannot hurt a man!
Fire cannot hurt a man. (Not the Government Man.)</p>

<p>All I want is to breathe Thank you. Thank you
Won&rsquo;t you breathe with me?
Find a little space&hellip;So we move in-between I&rsquo;m so thin
And keep one step ahead of yourself. I&rsquo;m catching up with myself</p>

<p>All I want it to breathe
Won&rsquo;t you breathe with me Hands of a Government Man
Find a little space so we move in-between
And keep one step ahead of yourself. Don&rsquo;t you miss it! Don&rsquo;t you
   miss it!</p>

<p>And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;
And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;
And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;
Where the hands has been&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;And the heat goes
on&hellip;And the heat goes on&hellip;</p>
