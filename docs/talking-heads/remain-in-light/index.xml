      <description>Writing down the chords of Born under Punches seems to be a little strange since there&amp;rsquo;s actualy only one basic riff being played. But I was asked to do it anyhow, so here it is:
|:Gm7 Gm7(+9):|
Gm7 ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-

      <description>The story about Remain in light is almost getting a little boring: Crosseyed and Painless exists again of just one or two chords! Two guitars are playing Bm7: one on the second fret, the other on the seventh.
(First guitar) Bm7 ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-
Bm7(+6) ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- ||&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-
|:Bm7 Bm7+6:|
(Second guitar) |:A Bm :|
Lost my shape-Trying to act casual! Can&amp;rsquo;t stop-I might end up in the hospital I&amp;rsquo;m changing my shape-I feel like an accident They&amp;rsquo;re back!</description>

      <title>The Great Curve</title>

      <description>Like so many song on Remain in Light, The Great Curve exists of only one guitar chord:
|:Fm :|
Sometimes the world has a load of questions Seems like the world knows nothing at all The world is near but it&amp;rsquo;s out of reach Some people touch it&amp;hellip;but they can&amp;rsquo;t hold on.
She is moving to describe the world Night must fall now-darker, darker. She has messages for everyone Night must fall now-darker, darker.</description>

      <title>Once In A Lifetime</title>

      <description>It seems like the basis of the verses exists only by the A7sus4 chord. Around this chord the rhythm section is playing along with the bass playing the |:F A |F A :| part. When playing the song on guitar without a band you can make the verses less boring by playing the bass part on the guitar&amp;hellip;
A7sus4 |&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash; |&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash; |&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash; |&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;ndash;x&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash; |&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash; |&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;|&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;

      <description>|:Em |D :|
For a long time I felt without style or grace Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather I knew my heart was in the right place I knew I&amp;rsquo;d be able to do these things.
And as we watch him digging his own grave It is important to know that was where he&amp;rsquo;s at He can&amp;rsquo;t afford to stop&amp;hellip;That is what he believe He&amp;rsquo;ll keep on digging for a thousand years.</description>

He would see faces in movies, on T.V., in magazines, and in books&amp;hellip;. |D |:Em |D :| He thought that some of these faces might be right for him&amp;hellip;.And through the years, by keeing an ideal facial structure fixed in his mind&amp;hellip;.Or somewhere in the back of his mind&amp;hellip;.That he might, by force of will, cause his face to approach those of his ideal..

Mojique, sees his village from a nearby hill Mojique, thinks of days before Americans came He sees the foreigners in growing numbers He sees the foreigners in fancy houses He thinks of days that he can still remember&amp;hellip; now
Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands Mojique sends the package to the American man Sofly he glides along the streets and alleys Up comes the wind that makes them run forever he feels the time is surely now or never&amp;hellip; more</description>

      <description>Another one chord song (how do they do it!)
|:Em :|
A TERRIBLE SIGNAL TOO WEAK TO EVEN RECOGNIZE A GENTLE COLLAPSING THE REMOVAL OF THE INSIDES
I&amp;rsquo;M TOUCHED BY YOUR PLEAS I VALUE THESE MOMENTS WE&amp;rsquo;RE ORDER THAN WE REALIZE &amp;hellip;IN SOMEONE&amp;rsquo;S EYES
A FREQUENT RETURNING AND LEAVING UNNOTICED A CONDITION OF MERCY A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER
A VIEW TO REMEMBER THE CENTER IS MISSING THEY QUESTION HOW THE FUTURE LIES &amp;hellip;IN SOMEONE&amp;rsquo;S EYES THE GENTLE COLLAPSING OF EVERY SURFACE WE TRAVEL ON THE QUIET ROAD &amp;hellip;THE OVERLOAD</description>
