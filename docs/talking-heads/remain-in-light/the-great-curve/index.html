  <h1>The Great Curve</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>Like so many song on Remain in Light, The Great Curve exists
of only one guitar chord:</p>

<p>|:Fm    :|</p>

<p>Sometimes the world has a load of questions
Seems like the world knows nothing at all
The world is near but it&rsquo;s out of reach
Some people touch it&hellip;but they can&rsquo;t hold on.</p>

<p>She is moving to describe the world
Night must fall now-darker, darker.
She has messages for everyone
Night must fall now-darker, darker.
She is moving by remote control
Night must fall now-darker, darker.
Hands that move her are invisible
Night must fall now-darker, darker.</p>

<p>The world has a way of looking at people
Sometimes it seems that the world is wrong
She loves the world, and all the people in it
She shakes &lsquo;em up when she start to walk.</p>

<p>She is only party human being
Divine, to define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so
She defines the possibilities
Divine, to define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so
Holding on for an Eternity
Divine, to define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so
Gone&hellip;ending without finishing
Divine, to define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so</p>

<p>The world moves on a womans hips
The world moves and it swivels and bops
The world moves on a womans hips
The world moves and it bounces and hopsu
A world of light&hellip;she&rsquo;s gonna open our eyes up
A world of light&hellip;she&rsquo;s gonna open our eyes up
She&rsquo;s gonna hold/it move/it hold it/move it hold/it move it hold/
   it move it
A world of light&hellip;she&rsquo;s gonna open out eyes up</p>

<p>She is moving to describe the world
Night must fall now-darker, darker.
She has messages for everyone
Night must fall now-darker, darker.
She is moving by remote control
Night must fall now-darker, darker.
Hands that move her are invisible
Night must fall now-darker, darker.</p>

<p>Divine, to define, she is moving to define, so say so
Night must fall now-darker, darker.
She&hellip;has got to move the world&hellip;to move the world&hellip;to move
   the world</p>

<p>A world of light&hellip;she&rsquo;s gonna open our eyes up
A world of light&hellip;she&rsquo;s gonna open our eyes up
She&rsquo;s gonna hold/it move/it hold it/move it hold/it move it hold/
   it move it
A world of light&hellip;she&rsquo;s gonna open out eyes up</p>

<p>Wanna define&hellip;so say so, so say so
Divine to define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so
Night must fall now-darker, darker.
She&hellip;has got to move the world&hellip;to move the world&hellip;to move
   the world</p>
