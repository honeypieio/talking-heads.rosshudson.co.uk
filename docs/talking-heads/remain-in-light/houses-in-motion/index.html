  <h1>Houses In Motion</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Em    |D    :|</p>

<p>For a long time I felt without style or grace
Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather
I knew my heart was in the right place
I knew I&rsquo;d be able to do these things.</p>

<p>And as we watch him digging his own grave
It is important to know that was where he&rsquo;s at
He can&rsquo;t afford to stop&hellip;That is what he believe
He&rsquo;ll keep on digging for a thousand years.</p>

<p>|:Em          G   Em            G          Em     G Em  :|
I&rsquo;m walking a line-I&rsquo;m thining about empty motion
I&rsquo;m walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-No time to begin
This isn&rsquo;t the time-So nothing was done
Not talking about-Not many at all
I&rsquo;m turning around-No trouble at all
You notice there&rsquo;s nothing around you, around you
I&rsquo;m walking a line-Divide and dissolve.</p>

<p>|:Em    |D    :|</p>

<p>Never get to say much, never get to talk
Tell us a little bit, but not too much
Right about then, is where she give up
She has closed her eyes, she has give up hope</p>

<p>|:Em          G   Em            G          Em     G Em  :|</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m walking a line-I hate to be dreaming in motion
I&rsquo;m walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-No time to begin
This isn&rsquo;t the time-So nothing was done
Not talking about-Not many at all
I&rsquo;m turning around-No trouble at all
I&rsquo;m keeping my fingers behind me, &lsquo;hind me
I&rsquo;m walking a line-Divide and dissolve.</p>

<p>|:Em    |D    :|</p>

<p>I turn myself around, I&rsquo;m moving backwards and forwards
I&rsquo;m moving twice as much as I was before
I&rsquo;ll keep on digging to the center of the Earth
I&rsquo;ll be down in there moving the in the room&hellip;</p>

<p>|:Em          G   Em            G          Em     G Em  :|</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m walking a line-Visiting houses in motion
I&rsquo;m walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-No time to begin
This isn&rsquo;t the time-So nothing was done
Not talking about-Not many at all
I&rsquo;m turning around-No trouble at all
Two different houses surround you, &lsquo;round you
I&rsquo;m walking a line-Divide and dissolve.</p>

<p>|:Em    |D    :|</p>
