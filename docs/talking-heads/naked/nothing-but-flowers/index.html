  <h1>(Nothing But) Flowers</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:A   |E    |D   :|</p>

<p>|:A   |C#m   |Bm   |E   :|
Here we stand
Like an Adam and an Eve
Waterfalls
The Garden of Eden
Two fools in love
So beautiful and strong
The birds in the trees
Are smiling upon them</p>

<p>|:G#    |C#m    :|
From the age of the dinosaurs
Cars have run on gasoline
A      C#m
Where, where have they gone?
Bm        E
Now, it&rsquo;s nothing but flowers</p>

<p>|:A   |E    |D   :|
There was a factory
Now there are mountains and rivers
you got it, you got it</p>

<p>We caught a rattlesnake
Now we got something for dinner
we got it, we got it</p>

<p>|:B   |F#    |E    :|
There was a shopping mall
Now it&rsquo;s all covered with flowers
you&rsquo;ve got it, you&rsquo;ve got it</p>

<p>If this is paradise
I wish I had a lawnmower
you&rsquo;ve got it, you&rsquo;ve got it</p>

<p>|:A   |E    |D    :|</p>

<p>|:A   |C#m   |Bm   |E   :|
Years ago
I was an angry young man
I&rsquo;d pretend
That I was a billboard
Standing tall
By the side of the road
I fell in love
With a beautiful highway</p>

<p>|:G#    |C#m    :|
This used to be real estate
Now it&rsquo;s only fields and trees
A      Cm#
Where, where is the town
Bm        E
Now, it&rsquo;s nothing but flowers</p>

<p>|:Bm   |F#   :|
The highways and cars
Were sacrificed for agriculture
Dm                        A
I thought that we&rsquo;d start over
                  E
But I guess I was wrong</p>

<p>|:A   |E   |D   :|
Once there were parking lots
Now it&rsquo;s a peaceful oasis
you got it, you got it</p>

<p>This was a Pizza Hut
Now it&rsquo;s all covered with daisies
you got it, you got it</p>

<p>|:B   |F#    |E    :|
I miss the honky tonks,
Dairy Queens, and 7-Elevens
you got it, you got it</p>

<p>And as things fell apart
Nobody paid much attention
you got it, you got it</p>

<p>[SOLO] |:A   |E   |D   :|</p>

<p>I dream of cherry pies,
Candy bars, and chocolate chip cookies
you got it, you got it</p>

<p>We used to microwave
Now we just eat nuts and berries
you got it, you got it</p>

<p>This was a discount store,
Now it&rsquo;s turned into a cornfield
you got it, you got it</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t leave me stranded here
I can&rsquo;t get used to this lifestyle</p>
