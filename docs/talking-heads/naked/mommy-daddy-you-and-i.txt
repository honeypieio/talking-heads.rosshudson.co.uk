Dm               G7            Dm              G7
All the way from Baltimore, we couldn't find a seat
Dm                   G7            Dm              G7
Conductor says, he's sorry for the blisters on our feet
       D                    G7
Come a-riding in a bus, the high and the low
D                   G
Mommy daddy you and I
D                         G7
Going on a trip and we're not coming home
D                   G
mommy daddy you and I

D
Driving, keep driving
driving, driving all night
G7                     D
Sleeping on my daddy's shoulders
G7                    D
Drinking from a paper cup

        G                       D
And I'm wearing my grandfathers clothes
         G                         D
And they say that up north it gets cold

Dm              G7             Dm            G7
Crawling out of bed one night, walking in my sleep
      Dm           G7         Dm               G7
We're not the only family, to take this little trip
        D                    G7
Driving all the way up, it's 30 below
D                   G
Mommy daddy you and I
D                         G7
Even little kids, getting ready to go
D                   G
Mommy daddy you and I

D
Chilly, chilly willy
It's colder teh further we go
G                       D
Some are born to take advantage
    G                       D
But saying it don't make it so
   G                        D
So hold me and don't let me go
          G                          D
Cause the sidewalks are covered with snow

C             G                    C                 G
He's speaking English now and he's smoothing out his clothes
Bb       G            Bb            G
He's Mr. Button down, he is leaving home

Dm             G7             Dm                 G7
Making changes day by day, we still ain't got no plans
Dm              G7           Dm              G7
How we're gonna make our way in this foreign land

                D
Well we'll keep driving, keep driving
We're driving with all of our might
Changing, still changing
Changing the water of life

G                      D
Keep that little man a shining
    G                        D
See how the tail can wag the dog
          G                      D
And we're all riding in this old bus
        G                    D
And the driver is singing to us
          G                        D
And we're wearing our grandfathers clothes
          G                           D
'Cause we heard that up north it gets cold
