<p>riff + |:Dm  (+6) :|</p>

<p>Signs
Signs are lost
Signs disappeared
Turn invisible
Got no sign
Somebody got busted
Got a face of stone
And a ghostwritten biography
Dogs start to run in,
Hungry for some food
Dogs start a-twitching
And they&rsquo;re looking at you
It was light
By five
Torn all apart
All in the name of democracy
He&rsquo;s hurt
He&rsquo;s dying
Claimed he was a terrorist
Claimed to avert a catastrophe
Someone should&rsquo;a told him
That the buck stops here
No one ever said
That he was involved with thieves
And they&rsquo;re blind, blind
blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
blind, blind
blind, blind, blind, blind, blind</p>

<p>Cm                   Am
No sense of harmony, No sense of time,
Cm
Don&rsquo;t mention harmony,
     Am
Say: What is it? What is it? What is it?
Cm                                     Am
Give a little shock, and he raises his hand
Cm                         Am
Somebody shouts out, says: What is it? What is it? What is it?</p>

<p>G                       Am
He was shot down in the night!
G                      Am
People ride by but his body&rsquo;s still alive
G                                   Am
The girl in the window what has she done?
G
She looks down at me &hellip;
       Am
says: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riff + |:Dm  (+6) :|
And I&rsquo;m blind, blind
blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
blind, blind
blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Somebody could have told us where they go
Crawling all around looking for foot, foot, footprints
Now tell me what the Hell have we become?
Some dirty little bastards What the Hell is going on?u
|:Cm   |Am   :|
No sense of harmony, No sense of
time, Don&rsquo;t mention harmony, Say:
What is it? What is it? What is it? Give
a little shock, and he raises his hand
Somebody shouts out, says: What is
it? What is it? What is it?
|:G    |Am   :|
  He was shot down in the night! Peop-
ple ride by but his body&rsquo;s still alive
The girl in the window what has she
done? She looks down at me &hellip;
says: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riff + |:Dm  (+6) :|
They&rsquo;re blind and they&rsquo;re blind
blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
blind, blind
blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
blind, blind
blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
blind, blind
blind, blind, blind, blind, blind</p>
