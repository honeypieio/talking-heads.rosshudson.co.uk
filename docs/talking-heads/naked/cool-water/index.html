    <p>|:Bb   |Dm   :|
|:Dm   |G    :|</p>

<p>|:D#    |Dm  :|
Day by day &hellip; Whistle while you work &hellip; Our
backs are breaking &hellip;  Up from hollow earth &hellip;
From end to end &hellip; The noise begins &hellip; In the
human battle stations &hellip; And the big one&rsquo;s
coming in</p>

<p>|:Dm   |Gm    :|
Work, work, work, work &hellip; Work till holes are
filled &hellip; Work, work, work, work &hellip; Bags of
bone and skin &hellip;</p>

<p>Em7
Lovers hold hands &hellip; Tossing
their heads &hellip; Tangled in hair &hellip; Tied to earth
&hellip; With skin and glue</p>

<p>|:G   |D# D   :|
But their skin is the same as yours
Coming in for the world to see
They can sit at the table, too
The same blood as you and me
|:Gm   :|
Dm                   D#               Dm
Speak very softly .. Hold my hand &hellip; Someone is
             D#            Dm
sleeping &hellip; In my bed &hellip; Priests pass by &hellip;
D#                 Dm                   D#
Worms crawl in &hellip; One dreams to be &hellip; One dream for all</p>

<p>|:G   |D# D   :|
His skin is the same as yours
Is he not made the same as you?
And some have fallen down
And blood spilled on the ground</p>

<p>Dm         Gm
Work, work,work, work
Dm               Gm
Till his life is done</p>

<p>|:Em7  |   |D#  |   :|
|:Dm   |   |D#  |   :|
Dm
Gm
The old man .. Is at our door &hellip; And he&rsquo;s</p>

<p>knocking &hellip; knocking &hellip;<br />
|:D#   |Dm   :|
As his neighbors weep</p>

<p>&hellip; Each day repeats &hellip; Are we nothing in your
                                             Gm
eyes? &hellip; Someone answer, someone answer &hellip; This</p>

<p>rusted garden gate &hellip;  Can barely even stand &hellip;
 D#                            Gm
Their work is over now &hellip; And rest will be at</p>

<p>hand</p>

<p>|:G   |D# D   :|
Is their skin not the same as yours?
Can they sit at the table to drink
D#
Cool water
Gm
Cool water
Gm
And his lungs are filled with rain&hellip;
And the water&rsquo;s rushing in&hellip;</p>

<p>Hey buddy,
Just checking out your tres chic Heads tab site&hellip;..not bad.
May I make a suggestion on the Cool Water tab, though? Try using the chords Eb and Gm for the first verse and most of the others&hellip;.I think you&rsquo;ll find these are a little more accurate.
For the intro, try this:</p>

<p>E&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;
A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;6&ndash;6&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-6&ndash;6&mdash;&mdash;-5&ndash;5&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;5&mdash;5&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-5&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
E&mdash;&ndash;3&ndash;3&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;3&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-3&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;3&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-3&mdash;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s based on an Eb chord and a G5 (or Gm)</p>

<p>&hellip;for the &ldquo;lover&rsquo;s hold hands&rdquo; bit&hellip;..</p>

<p>E&mdash;&ndash;2&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
B&mdash;&ndash;1&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
G&mdash;&ndash;2&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;
D&mdash;&ndash;1&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;
A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
E&mdash;-(2)&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This is some sort of dimished chord, and certainly fits the song. Hook your thumb over the neck for the low E string.</p>

<p>Anyway, hope this helps. All I ask is a little mention somewhere on your page for my small contribution. I&rsquo;ll send you some more additions/suggestions as I have more time.</p>

<p>Thanks for putting together all those chords!</p>

<p>Damien Galt</p>
