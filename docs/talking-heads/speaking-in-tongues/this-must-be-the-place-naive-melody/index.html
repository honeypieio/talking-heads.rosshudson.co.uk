  <h1>This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:G   |Am   |Em   |Am   :|
(repeat this the whole song through)</p>

<p>Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me around
I feel numb, born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground, head in the sky
It&rsquo;s OK, I know nothing&rsquo;s wrong.. nothing</p>

<p>Hi yo, I got plenty of time
Hi yo, you got light in your eyes
And you&rsquo;re standing here beside me
And I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up and say goodnight&hellip; say goodnight</p>

<p>Home is where I want to be
But I guess I&rsquo;m already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
Guess that this must be the place
I can&rsquo;t tell one from another
Did I find you or you find me?
There was a time
Before we were born
If someone asks this is where I&rsquo;ll be</p>

<p>Hi yo, we drift in and out
Hi yo, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I&rsquo;m just an animal, looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till your heart stops
Love me till I&rsquo;m dead
Eyes that light up
Eyes that look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head
Ah ooh&hellip;</p>

  </pre>
