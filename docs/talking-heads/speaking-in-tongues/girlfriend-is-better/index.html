  <h1>Girlfriend Is Better</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>This is again one of these songs that&rsquo;s got one basic chord: Dm
On the chorusses Dm7 is being played</p>

<p>Dm (10th fret)
I &hellip; Who took the money?
  Who took the money away?
I &hellip; It&rsquo;s always showtime
  Here at the edge of the stage
I, I, I, wake up and wonder
  What was the place, what was the name?
We wanna wait, but here we go again&hellip;</p>

<p>I &hellip; takes over slowly
  But doesn&rsquo;t last very long
I &hellip; no need to worry
  Evr&rsquo;ything&rsquo;s under control
O - U - T  But no hard feelings
  What do you know?  Take you away
We&rsquo;re being taken for a ride again</p>

<p>Dm7 (5th fret)
I got a girlfriend that&rsquo;s better than that
  She has the smoke in her eyes
She&rsquo;s moving up, going right through my house
  She&rsquo;s ginna give me surprise
Better than this, know that It&rsquo;s right
  I think you can if you like
I git a girlfriend with bows in her hair
  And nothing is better than that</p>

<p>Dm (10th fret)
Down, down in the basement
  We hear the sound of machines
I, I, I&rsquo;m driving in circles
  Come to my senses sometimes
Why, why, why, why start it over?
  Nothing was lost, everthing&rsquo;s free
I don&rsquo;t care how impossible it seems</p>

<p>Somebody calls you but you cannot hear
  Get closer to be far away
Only one look and that&rsquo;s all that we need
  Maybe that&rsquo;s all that it takes
All that it takes, all that it takes
All that it takes, all that it takes
I got a girlfriend that&rsquo;s betther than that
  And she goes wherever she likes. (there she goes&hellip;)</p>

<p>Dm7 (5th fret)
I got a girlfriend that&rsquo;s better than that
  Now everyone&rsquo;s getting involved
She&rsquo;s moving up going right through my heart
  We might not ever get caught
Going right through     (try to stay cool)  going through, staying cool
I got a girlfriend that&rsquo;s better than that
And nothing is better than you</p>

<p>I got a girlfriend thats better that this
  And you don&rsquo;t remember at all
As we get older and stop making sense
  You won&rsquo;t find her waiting long
    Stop making sense, stop making sense&hellip;stop making sense, making sense
I got a girlfriend that&rsquo;s better than that
  And nothing is better that this
                        ( is it? )</p>
