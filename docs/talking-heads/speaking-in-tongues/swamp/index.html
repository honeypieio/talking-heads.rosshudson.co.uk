    <p>|:Am   :|
Am                        C
Now lemme tell you a story
Am                    C
The devil he has a plan
Am                          C
A bag a&rsquo; bones in his pocket
Am                 D Am
Got anything you want
   C   Am       C   Am
No dust and no rocks
              C Am
The whole thing is over
                 C Am            C Am
All these beauties in solid motion
                 C Am        D        Am
All those beauties, gonna swallow you up</p>

<p>Am
Hi hi hi hi hi,
     One time too many
     Too far to go
     I- We come to take you home</p>

<p>(as above)
And when they split those atoms
It&rsquo;s hotter than the sun
Blood is a special substance
They gonna pray for that man</p>

<p>So wake up young lovers
The whole thing is over
Watch but touch monkeys
All that blood, gonna swallow you whole</p>

<p>Hi hi hi hi hi
     What&rsquo;s that?  Who&rsquo;s driving?
     Where we goin&rsquo;?  Who knows?
     I- We come to take you home</p>

<pre><code> D              C  D             C
 How many people do you think I am
    D                     C
 Pretend I am somebody else
 D              C D                    C D
 You can pretend I'm and old millionaire
 D                               C
 A millionaire washing his hands
 D               C D                    C
 Rattle the bones, dreams that stick out
   D                        C Bm D
 A medical chart on the wall
 D            C    D                      C
 Soft violence and hands touch your throat
 D                      C
 Ev'ryone wants to explode
</code></pre>

<p>Am              C am         C
And when your hands get dirty
Am           C  Am        C Am
Nobody knows you at all
Am                              C  Am
Don&rsquo;t have a window to slip out of
Am          C      Am
Lights on, nobody home</p>

<p>(as above)
Click click- see ya later
Beta beta- no time to rest
Pika pika- risky business
All that blood, will never cover that mess.</p>

<p>Hi hi hi hi hi
     So soft hard feelings
     What&rsquo;s that, who&rsquo;s driving
     No tricks lets go
     I- We come to take you home
     I- We come to take you home
Hi hi hi hi hi
etc.</p>

  </pre>
