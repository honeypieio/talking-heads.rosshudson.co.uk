  <h1>Perfect World</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Gm    |Gm    |F    |F    :|</p>

<p>Well, I know what it is
But I don&rsquo;t know where it is
Where it is
Well, I know where it is
But I don&rsquo;t know what it looks like
What it looks like
Well, I know what it looks like,
But I don&rsquo;t know where she comes from
Well, I know where she comes from,
But I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s her name.</p>

<pre><code>           Am        Bb
</code></pre>

<p>(and she said) This is a perfect world
Am               Bb
I&rsquo;m riding on an incline
C#              F
I&rsquo;m staring in your face
Gm                Bbm
You&rsquo;ll photograph mine</p>

<p>|:Gm    |Gm    |F    |F    :|
And I&rsquo;ve been walking, talking
Believing the things that are true
And I&rsquo;ve been finding
The difference between right and wrong&hellip;good and bad
See me put things together
Put them back where they belong
Am I just like the others
Have I always been singing the same song</p>

<p>CHORUS</p>

<p>|:Gm    |Gm    |F    |F    :|
Somebody said that it happens all over the world
I do believe that it&rsquo;s true
And the sun&rsquo;s coming up
And we&rsquo;re doing all the things that we should
Doesn&rsquo;t everbody here believe in the things we do?</p>

<p>(And she said) CHORUS</p>

<p>|:Gm    |Gm    |F    |F    :|
It&rsquo;s a strange situation
What&rsquo;s wrong with you?
Baby&hellip;baby&hellip;baby
What you doing in my house?
And it&rsquo;s all true
There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with you</p>

<p>(And I said) CHORUS</p>

  </pre>
