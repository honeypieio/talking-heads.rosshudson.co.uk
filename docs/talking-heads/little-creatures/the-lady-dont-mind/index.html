  <h1>The Lady Don&#39;t Mind</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Am   |G   :|
Last time she jumped out the window, well, she only turned and
smiled. You might think she would say something, but you&rsquo;d have to
wait a while.</p>

<p>Well the lady don&rsquo;t mind.
No, no, no, the lady don&rsquo;t mind
She just turns her head and disappears,
I kinda like that style</p>

<p>Little boat that floats on a river, it&rsquo;s drifting through a haze
She stops by whenever she wants to, well, there she goes again</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s no trouble at all.
No, no, no trouble at all
Well, what she does
is all right with me, and
I kinda like that style</p>

<p>Come on. come on. I go up and down.
I like this curious feeling. I know, I see.
It&rsquo;s like make believe. Cover your ears
so you can hear what I&rsquo;m saying.
I&rsquo;m not lost but I don&rsquo;t know
Where I am. I got a question.
All right. All right. This is what we like.
Who knows, who knows,
What I&rsquo;m thinking</p>

<p>She says love is not what she&rsquo;s after,
and everyone knows.
Each time she looks in the mirror,
she lets her feelings show.</p>

<p>Well, the lady don&rsquo;t mind
No, no, no, the lady don&rsquo;t mind.
Well, what she says is all right by me,
and I kinda like that style</p>

<p>Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here we go again
I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know,
What I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;.
Hey man. Hey man.
I sure don&rsquo;t feel the same
She likes to say what she&rsquo;s feeling
Hey. Did I get a big surprise.
I know you think so.
Come on. Come on. She says anything.
Who knows, who knows,
what she&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
