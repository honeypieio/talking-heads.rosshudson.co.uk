    <p>|:E A       |A G       |G F       |F E       :|</p>

<p>E       A   A G               G F
Mommy had.     A little baby.
            F E              E A etc.
There he is.     Fast asleep.
He&rsquo;s just. A little plaything.
Why not. Wake him up?
Cute. Cute. Little baby.
Little pee pee. Little toes.
Now he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to me.
Crawl across. The kitchen floor.</p>

<p>A           G             E
Baby, baby, please let me hold him
A                     G      E
I wanna make him stay up all night
A               G           E
Sister, sister, he&rsquo;s just a plaything
A                      G      E
We wanna make him stay up all night
        A
Yeah we do</p>

<p>|:A G    |G F     |F E     :|</p>

<p>See him drink. From a bottle.
See him eat. From a plate.
Cute. Cute. As a button.
Don&rsquo;t you wanna make him. Stay up late.
And we&rsquo;re having fun. With no money.
Little smile. On his face.
Don&rsquo;t cha&rsquo; love. The little baby.
Don&rsquo;t you want to make him. Stay up late.</p>

<p>CHORUS</p>

<p>A               G     A
Here we go (all night long)
                    G    A
Sister, sister (all night long)
                            G    A
In the playpen&hellip;woo&hellip;(all night long)</p>

<p>Little baby goes, ha! (all night long)</p>

<p>I know you want to leave me&hellip;
E
Why don&rsquo;t. We pretend.
There you go. Little man.
Cute. Cute. Why not?
Late at night. Wake him up.</p>

<p>CHORUS</p>

<p>Here we go (all night long)
Sister, sister&hellip;woo&hellip;
(with the television on)
Little baby goes&hellip;woo! (all night long)
Hey, hey, baby! (all night long)
And he looks so cute (all night long)
In his little red suit (all night long)</p>

  </pre>
