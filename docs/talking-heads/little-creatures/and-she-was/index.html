  <h1>And She Was</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|E   |A   |</p>

<p>E           A            E
And she was lying in the grass
              A                E
And she could hear the highway breathing
              A            E
And she could see a nearby factory
             A               E
She&rsquo;s making sure she is not dreaming
Bb      F           G          F
See the lights of a neighbor&rsquo;s house
Bb        C           F
Now she&rsquo;s starting to rise
Bb     F         G     F
Take a minute to concentrate
        Bb    G       C
And she opens up her eyes</p>

<p>E             A                  D           A                E   |A  |D  |A
The world was moving and she was right there with it (and she was)
E             A                D       A                E
The world was moving she was floating above it (and she was)
|A   |D   |A         E   |:A    |E    :|
             and she was</p>

<p>|:A   |E   :|
And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth
Bb     F        C   F
Moving into the universe
Bb       C            F
Drifting this way and that
Bb    F      C         F
Not touching ground at all
Bb  G        C
Up above the yard</p>

<p>CHORUS</p>

<p>Bm
She was glad about it&hellip; no doubt about it
G
She isn&rsquo;t sure where she&rsquo;s gone
Bm
No time to think about what to tell them
G
No time to think about what she&rsquo;s done
        E  A  |:E   |A   :|
And she was</p>

<p>|:E   |A   :|
And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She&rsquo;s moving out in all directions</p>

<p>CHORUS</p>

<p>Joining the world of missing persons (and she was)
Missing enough to feel alright (and she was)</p>

  </pre>
