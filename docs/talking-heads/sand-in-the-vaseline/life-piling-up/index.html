  <h1>Lifetime Piling Up</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Am    |    G:|</p>

<p>I have tried marijuana
I get nervous any time
There will come a knockin&rsquo; at the door
Why is everybody makin&rsquo; eyes at me ?
I don&rsquo;t want to know
Excuse and pardon me
Stay for a while
Maybe we&rsquo;ll never
meet again</p>

<p>Am                    G
I can see my lifetime piling up
Am                           G
I can see the days turn into nights
Am                   G
I can see the people on the street
           Am<br />
Open those windows up
G
- A hundred floors below me
Am           G
Pilin&rsquo; those houses up
            Am              G
Pilin&rsquo; them higher, higher, higher
                Am               G
I can feel them swayin&rsquo; back and forth
            Am
Building it higher, higher
  G
- This tower&rsquo;s learning over</p>

<p>|:Am    |    G:|
I got bad coordination
Stuck a pencil in my eye
I can hardly wait to get back home
Why is everybody gettin&rsquo; paranoid ?
I&rsquo;s only havin&rsquo; fun
Scum bags and superstars
Tell me your names
I&rsquo;ll make a bet, you&rsquo;re
both the same</p>

<p>Am                    G
I can see my lifetime pilin&rsquo; up
Am                       G
Reaching from my bedroom to the stars
Am                        G
I can see the house where I was born
            Am           G
When I was growin&rsquo; up&hellip; they say that
              Am               G
I could never keep my trousers up
           Am             G
I remember days and crazy nights
              Am              G
Are there any pirates on this ship ?
            Am         G
And if they sober up - they have us</p>

<p>Home by morning</p>

<p>|:Em   :|
          F
Cry, cry, cry
                  Am
It&rsquo;s just you and I -
              Em
Like an automobile
                   Am
with no one at the wheel
                F
Spinning out of control
                   Am
We&rsquo;re all over the road
               Em
In our sexy machine
All the passengers scream
Scream, scream !</p>

<p>|:Am   |G   :|
I can see my lifetime pilin&rsquo; up
I can see it smashin&rsquo; into yours
It was not as accident at all
Open those windows up - I hear you laughin&rsquo;</p>

<p>Goin&rsquo; from the bottom to the top
Maybe I&rsquo;m holding on too tight
And now I&rsquo;m foldin&rsquo; up
I got a funny feeling
Pilin&rsquo; them houses up
Pilin&rsquo; them higher, higher, higher
Building that highway to the stars
Turning the music up - Hey!
I got a winning number</p>
