  <h1>Found A Job</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>Gm
&ldquo;Damn that television &hellip; what a bad picture&rdquo;!
C
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get upset, It&rsquo;s not a major disaster&rdquo;.
Gm
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing on tonight&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
   what&rsquo;s the matter&rdquo;!
C
&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s ever on&rdquo;, she said,
G
&ldquo;so &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know why you bother.&rdquo;
    GO ON AS ABOVE
We&rsquo;ve heard this little scene, we&rsquo;ve heard it many times.
People fighting over little things and wasting precious time.
They might be better off &hellip; I thing &hellip; the way it seems to me.
Making up their own shows, which might be better than T.V.</p>

<p>(CHORUS)
|:Em   G      Em  G      Em      G   Em G:|
Judy&rsquo;s in the bedroom, inventing situations.
Em     G      Em       D     Em      G    Em  G
Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations.
Em         G     Em          A
They&rsquo;ve enlisted all their family.
Em         G     Em         D
They&rsquo;ve enlisted all their friends.
   Em            D      Em     D
It helped saved their relationship,
    Em       D     E
And made it work again &hellip;</p>

<p>|:Gm   |     |C     |     :|
Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit.
There might even be a spinoff, but they&rsquo;re not sure &lsquo;bout that.
If they ever watch T.V. again, it&rsquo;d be too soon for them.
Bob never yells about the picture now, he&rsquo;s having
   too much fun.</p>

<p>(CHORUS)</p>

<p>Judy&rsquo;s in the bedroom, inventing situations,
Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations.
They&rsquo;ve enlisted all their family.
They&rsquo;ve enlisted all their friends.
It helped save their relationship,
And made it work again &hellip;</p>

<p>So think about this little scene; apply it to you life.
If your work isn&rsquo;t what you love, then something isn&rsquo;t right.
Just look at Bob and Judy; they&rsquo;re happy as can be,
Inventinting situations, putting them on T.V.</p>

<p>(CHORUS)</p>

<p>Judy&rsquo;s in the bedroom, inventing situations.
Dod is on the street today, scouting up locations.
They&rsquo;ve enlisting all their family.
They&rsquo;ve enlisted all their friends.
It helped save the relationship,
And made it work again &hellip;</p>

<p>Hey guys, your chords are wrong for Found a Job (More Songs&hellip;)
&gt;From &ldquo;More Songs&hellip;&rdquo;, If the 1st chord is A7, then it goes (line by line):
A7
A7
D7
A7
(repeat for 2nd verse)
CHORUS:
E A E G
E A E G
E D E D
E A E G
E G E A (Em G Em A)
E G A F# (Em G A F#)
B D B D
B D E _</p>

<p>And so on. The Stop Making Sense (movie) version is slightly different. It
sounds like the 5th chorus verse has chords E G D A instead of E G E A (or
the Em equivalent).
Yours
Adam Klein</p>
