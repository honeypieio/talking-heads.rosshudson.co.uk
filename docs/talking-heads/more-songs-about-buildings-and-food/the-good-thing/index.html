  <h1>The Good Thing</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:G  Em    :|
I will fight; will fight with my heart.
I will fight; will fight with understanding.
In my mind, the weather never changes
Skill overcomes, difficult situations.</p>

<p>A                C             D          F
A straight line exists between me and the good things.
A                 C               D         F
I have found the line and its direction is known to me.
A                        C           D         F
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction.
A                C          D                 F
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing.</p>

<p>|:G  Em    :|
Try to compare what I am presenting.
You will meet with much frustration.
Try to find &hellip; similar situation.
You will always find the same solution.</p>

<p>|:A     |C     |D     |F     |     :|</p>

<p>As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied.
Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction.
As we economise, efficiency is multiplied,
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing.
So I say:
Gm                       F
I have adopted this and made it my own:
Gm                          F
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.
Gm                       F
I have adopted this and made it my own:
Gm                          F
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.</p>

<p>|:Gm   |D   G                       F
I have adopted this and made it my own:
Gm                          F
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.
|:Gm   |D   :|
Watch me work</p>

  </pre>
