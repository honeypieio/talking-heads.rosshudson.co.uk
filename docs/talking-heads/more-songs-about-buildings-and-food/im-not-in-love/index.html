  <h1>I&#39;m Not In Love</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>(tURN YOUR PITCH A LITTLE HIGHER)</p>

<p>|:Am   |    |    |Am Gm F Gm :|
&hellip;Pretty!
What is? Brand new? Well that&rsquo;s not the way I think of you.
You&rsquo;ll touch me, in a minute; but that&rsquo;s not what I want to do.
|:C Bm      :|
We are two strangers,
We might never have met.
We can talk forever, I understand what you said.
          C   Bm  G
But I&rsquo;m&hellip;not in love.
                      C   Bm  G
What does it take to fall in love?
                  C   Bm  A
Do people really fall in love?</p>

<p>(REST AS ABOVE)</p>

<p>&hellip;Happy!
Is there time for this? Is this responsibility?
Girl time, boy time, is that the difference between me and you?
I won&rsquo;t ask any questions,
Who needs to make a new start?
I choose to believe you,
I said before that I can&rsquo;t.
&hellip;&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m not in love.
What does it take to fall in love?
Why would I want to fall in love?</p>

<p>&hellip;Feeling!
Take it easy baby&hellip;Don&rsquo;t let your feelings get in the way.
Some day, I believe, we can live in a world without love.
I can answer your questions,
If you won&rsquo;t twist what I say.
Please respect my opinions,
They will be respected some day.
Because we don&rsquo;t need love.
I believe that we don&rsquo;t need love.
There&rsquo;ll come a day when we won&rsquo;t need love.</p>

<p>(fREAK oN&hellip;)</p>
