  <h1>The Girls Want To Be With The Girls</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:D   |C    :|
The girls don&rsquo;t want to play like that,
They just want to talk to the boys.
The just want to do what is in their hearts,
And the girls want to be with the girls.</p>

<p>(CHORUS)
|:C  Dm  |F     :|</p>

<p>And the boys say, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
And the boys say, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
|:Am   |Dm   :|
Well there is just no love,
When there&rsquo;s boys and girls.
|:C  Dm  |F     :|<br />
And the girls want to be with the girls,
And the girls want to be with the girls.</p>

<p>|Am   |    |D    |     |
|C    |    |D    |     |
|:D   |C    :|
Girls want things that make common sense,
The best for all concerned.
They don&rsquo;t want to have to go out of their way,
And the girls want to be with the girls.</p>

<p>Girls are getting into abstract analysis
They want to make that intuitive leap
They are making plans that have far reaching effects
And the girls want to be with the girls</p>

<p>(CHORUS)(as above)</p>

<p>And the boys say, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
And the boys say, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
Well there is just no love,
When there&rsquo;s boys and girls.
And the girls want to be with the girls,
And the girls want to be with the girls.</p>

<p>|:C     |    |D    |      :|</p>
