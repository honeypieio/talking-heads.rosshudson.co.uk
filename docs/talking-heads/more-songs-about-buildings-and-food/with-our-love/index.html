  <h1>With Our Love</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Gm Am  |Bbm   |
|Gm  Am  |Gm   :|
It&rsquo;s just a look, and it makes the boys quiver.
Yes, it&rsquo;s just the look, and now they remember.
C#m         Bm         C#m           Bm
Had they forgotten &hellip; what this all means?
|:Gm Am  |Bbm   |
|Gm  Am  |Gm   :|
I think they want to forget,
And they hope that this time.</p>

<p>(CHORUS)
|:A   |E   :|2x
I won&rsquo;t look,
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
I&rsquo;ve got other things to do now.
|:A   |E   :|2x
I forgot what it was,
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
I&rsquo;ve got to get to work now.
|:A   |E   :|2x
(And they) set an example for us (I see it!).
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
It can happen to me too.
|:A   |E   :|2x
(And it) didn&rsquo;t make any difference to us (But I)
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that&rsquo;s the trouble.
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that&rsquo;s the trouble.
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that&rsquo;s the trouble.
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that&rsquo;s the trouble.
|:Am  Em  :|
With our love, With our love, WITH OUR LOVE</p>

<p>|:Gm Am  |Bbm   |
|Gm  Am  |Gm   :|
They hear the words, such as &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really special&rdquo;
(And they) can&rsquo;t face the feeling.
(And they) can&rsquo;t really tell
I look out the window,
(And I) I call that education.
(And I) See all my friends standing out there
(And I) I call that education (sophistication)</p>

<p>C#m           Bm            C#m         Bm
Things got so busy and they won&rsquo;t be offended
|:Gm Am  |Bbm   |
|Gm  Am  |Gm   :|
Things come and go (and I see &lsquo;em)
And I wont be neglected (not this time!)</p>

<p>(REPEAT CHORUS)</p>

<p>(Any remarks, suggestions, approvements, comments, please
reach me at hvz@dds.nl)</p>

<p>AND THIS VERSION MIGHT BE BETTER THAN MY INTERPRETATION:</p>

<p>Why would I be writing if I thought the tab was correct?  Why am I writing
at all?  I don&rsquo;t know.  So, here is what I hear:</p>

<p>(CHORUS)
|:A   |E   :|2x
I won&rsquo;t look,
|:G   |E   :|2x
I&rsquo;ve got other things to do now.
|:A   |E   :|2x
I forgot what it was,
|:G   |E   :|2x
I&rsquo;ve got to get to work now.
|:A   |E   :|2x
(And they) set an example for us (I see it!).
|:G   |E   :|2x
It can happen to me too.
|:A   |E   :|2x
(And it) didn&rsquo;t make any difference to us (But I)
|:G   |E   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that&rsquo;s the trouble.
|:G   |E   :|2x</p>

<p>Everywhere you had a |Gm  A|, I think it&rsquo;s really |G  E|
Sounds right when I play it.</p>

<p>Then, this part below.  I don&rsquo;t know the name of the chord, so I called it
Am-3 because you&rsquo;re removing the 3rd note in the AM Scale (the C).
Played on the 12th fret, this seems to be correct:</p>

<p>|:Am  Am-3  :|
With our love, With our love, WITH OUR LOVE</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;d be playing Am, and lifting the C, which would be the 13th fret on
the B string.</p>

<p>And of course the intro is/seems to be:</p>

<p>G   - A   - Bb   |  x2
A   - Bb -C     |  x2
Bb - C  -Db    |  x2</p>

<p>All on the G-string, single notes, NOT CHORDS.</p>

<p>This seems to be more correct.</p>
