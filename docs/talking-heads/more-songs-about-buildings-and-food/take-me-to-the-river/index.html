  <h1>Take Me To The River</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>(This song is impossible to play if you write it down
the way it should be. What you&rsquo;ll find here is how I play
it. Hope it makes sense to ya&rsquo;)</p>

<p>|:E    | F#m  G  :|
I don&rsquo;t know why I love her like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven&rsquo;t seen the worst of it yet
        C            G
I wanna know can you tell me
A          Em7
I love to stay
               E     F#m G E                 F#m G E
Take me to the river,      drop me in the water
               E     F#m G E                 F#m G E
Take me to the river,      dip me in the water
G F#m      E     G F#m      E
Washing me down, washing me down</p>

<p>|:E    | F#m  G  :|
I don&rsquo;t know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things we could have had
Love is an ocean that I can&rsquo;t forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret</p>

<pre><code>    C                G
</code></pre>

<p>I wanna know that you&rsquo;ll tell me
A          Em7
I love to stay
|:E    | F#m  G  :|
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Push me in the river, dip me in the water
G F#m      E     G F#m      E
Washing me down, washing me</p>

<p>C#m      A          C#m      A          Em7
Hold me, squeeze me, love me, tease me
Till I can&rsquo;t, till I can&rsquo;t, till I can&rsquo;t take no more of it
E                    F#m G E
Take me to the water,      drop me in the river
E                    F#m G E
Push me in the water,      drop me in the river
F#m G      E     F#m G        E
Washing me down, washing me down</p>

<p>|:E    | F#m  G  :|
I don&rsquo;t know why I love you like I do
All the troubles you put me through
Sixteen candles there on my wall
And here am I the biggest fool of them all</p>

<pre><code>     C                G
</code></pre>

<p>I wanna know that you&rsquo;ll tell me
A           Em7
I love to stay
|:E    | F#m  G  :|
Take me to the river and drop me in the water
Dip me in the river, drop me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down.</p>

  </pre>
