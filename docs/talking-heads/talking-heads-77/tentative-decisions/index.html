  <h1>Tentative Decisions</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>|:Em    G:|
Now that I can
Release my tensions
Let me make clear
My best intentions
Girls ask and I
define decision
Boys ask and I
describe their function</p>

<pre><code>    C   FC
</code></pre>

<p>Oh the boys want to talk
           F                G
Like to to talk about those problems
        C         FC
And the girls say they&rsquo;re concerned
             F                    G
And they are concerned with these decisions
          C             FC
And it&rsquo;s all hard Logic
                  F         G
To follow and the girls get lost
        C        FC
And the boys say they&rsquo;re concerned
            F                     G
But they are concerned with these decisions</p>

<pre><code>     C
</code></pre>

<p>I wanna talk
                D
I wanna talk as much as I want
          C
I&rsquo;m gonna give
                   D
I&rsquo;m gonna give the problem to you
         C
I wanna talk
                D
I wanna talk as much as I want
          C
I&rsquo;m gonna give
                   D
I&rsquo;m gonna give the problem to you
G
Decide, decide
Make up your mind
Decide, decide
I told you what to say
Confuse, confuse
Describe what I found
Confuse, confuse
I told you what to say</p>

<p>|:Em    G:|</p>

<pre><code>   C           FC
</code></pre>

<p>Oh the girls still want to talk
        F                G
Want to talk about those problems
        C        FC
And the boys say they&rsquo;re concerned
             F                    G
But they are concerned with these decisions</p>

<pre><code>        C           FC
</code></pre>

<p>And it&rsquo;s all hard Logic
               F         G
I know and the girls get lost
        C        FC
And the boys say they&rsquo;re concerned
                F                 G
And they are concerned with these decisions
        C                     D
I wanna talk, I wanna talk as much as I want
          C                        D
I&rsquo;m gonna give, I&rsquo;m gonna give the problem to you
         C                    D
I wanna talk, I wanna talk as much as I want
          C                        D              G
I&rsquo;m gonna give, I&rsquo;m gonna give the problem to you</p>
