  <h1>Don&#39;t Worry About The Government</h1>

  <pre>
    <p>C                          A
I see the clouds that move across the sky
C                             A
I see the wind that moves the clouds away
G                   F           Am
It moves the clouds over by the building
G                        F         Am
I pick the building that I want to live in</p>

<p>(CHORDS AS ABOVE)
I smell the pine trees and the peaches in the woods
I see the pinecones that fall by the highway
That&rsquo;s the highway that goes to the building
I pick the building that I want to live in</p>

<p>C                     F    G
It&rsquo;s over there, it&rsquo;s over there
D               G
My building has every convenience
D                    G
It&rsquo;s gonna make life easy for me
D                     G
It&rsquo;s gonna be easy to get things done
D             G
I will relax alone with my loved ones</p>

<p>E                      D
Loved ones, loved ones visit the building,
         E                 D
take the highway, park and come up and see me
         E                   D
I&rsquo;ll be working, working but If you come visit
         E                       D
I&rsquo;ll put down what I&rsquo;m doing, my friends are important</p>

<p>F         G           D
Don&rsquo;t you worry &lsquo;bout me
F          Am          D
I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about me
F          G          D
Don&rsquo;t you worry &lsquo;bout me
F          Am         D
Don&rsquo;t you worry &lsquo;bout me</p>

<p>C                 A
I see the states, across this big nation
C                      A
I see the laws made in Washington, D.C.
G                     F           Am
I think of the ones I consider my favorites
G                              F           Am
I think of the people that are working for me</p>

<p>(CHORDS AS ABOVE)
Some civil servants are just like my loved ones
They work so hard and they try to be strong
I&rsquo;m a lucky guy to live in my building
They own the buildings to help them along</p>

<pre><code> C                F     G

<p>It&rsquo;s over there, it&rsquo;s over there
D               G
My building has every convenience
