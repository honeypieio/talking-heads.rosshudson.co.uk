<p>Electric guitar    is run over    by a car on the highway
Am        Bb    Gm          C
This is a crime against the state
Bb          F           C
This is the meaning of life.
Am
To tune this electric guitar
                 F#m  Em             Fm               F#m
An electric guitar        is brought in to a court of law
                  Fm                          Am
The judge and the jury (twelve members of the jury)

All listening to records
Am        Bb    Gm          C
This is a crime against the state
Bb          F            C
This is the verdict they reach:
Am
Never listen to electric guitar
              F#m      E            Fm
Electric guitar       is copies, the copy sounds better
              F#m                       Fm<br />
Call this the law of justice, call this freedom and liberty
            Am               Fm
I thought I perjure myself, right infront of the jury!
Am         C     G           C
Is this a crime against the state? No!
Bb          F            C

Am
Someone controls electric guitar.</p>
