<p>D             C D                C
Hold the paper    up to the light
Am                    F
(some rays pass right through)
D               C D                       C
Expose yourself     out there for a minute
Am                      F
(some rays pass right through)</p>

<p>|:Bb C      Bb:|
Take a little rest when the rays pass through
Take a little time off when the rays pass through
Go ahead and mis it up&hellip; Go ahead and tie it up
In a long distance telephone call</p>

<p>|:F G    F :|
Hold on to that paper
Hold on to that paper
D
Hold on becuase it&rsquo;s been taken care of
|:F G    F :|
Hold on to that paper</p>

<p>|:G      F:|
See if you can fit it on the paper
See if you can get it on the paper
See if you can fit it on the paper
See if you can get it on the paper</p>

<p>D                 C D
Had a love affair      but it was only paper
Am                                 F
(some rays they pass right through)
D                C D
Had a lot of fun,    could have been a lot better
Am                                 F
(some rays they pass right through)</p>

<p>|:Bb C      Bb:|
Take a little consideration, take every combination
Take a few weeks off, make it tighter, tighter
But it was never, it was never written down
Still might be a chance that it might work out (if you)</p>

<p>|:F G    F :|
Hold on to that paper
Hold on to that paper
D
Hold on because it&rsquo;ll be taken care of
|:F G    F :|
Hold on to that paper</p>

<p>|:G      F:|
Don&rsquo;t think I can fit it on the paper
Don&rsquo;t think I can get it on the paper
Go ahead and rip up, rip up the paper
Go ahead and tear up, tear up the paper</p>
