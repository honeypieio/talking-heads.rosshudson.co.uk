I'm mad...And that's a fact
I found out...Animals don't help
Animal think...They're pretty smart
Shit on the ground...See in the dark.

They wander around like a crazy dog
Make a mistake in the parking lot
Always bumping into things
Always let you down down down down.

Animals speak, they understand
Trusting them is a big mistake
Animals want to change my life
I will ignore animals advise

They're never there when you need them
They never come when you call them
They're never there when you need them
The nevere come when you call them down down down down.

I know the animals...Are laughing at us
They don't even know...What a joke is
I won't follow...Animal's advice
I don't care...If they're laughing at us.
