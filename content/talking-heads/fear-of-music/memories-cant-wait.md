Do you remember anyone here?
No you don't remember anything at all
I'm sleeping, I'm flat on my back
Never woke up, had no regrets


There's a party in my mind...And it never stops
There's a party up there all the time...They'll
   party till they drop
B                   C      B                     C
Other people can go home...Other people they can split
B                    C      B           C
I'll be here all the time...I can never quit

|:C#    |         F# C# :|
Take a walk through the land of shadows
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows
Try not to look so disappointed
It isn't what you hoped for, is it?
Esus7           A6    Bm     Esus7         A6     Bm
There's a party in my mind...And I hope it never stops
Esus7          A6      Bm     Esus7       A6    Bm
I'm stuck here in this seat...I might not stand up

B                   C      B                  C                 
Other people can go home...Everyone else will split
B                    C      B           C
I'll be here all the time...I can never quit

G     Bm            F    C
Everything is very quiet
G            Am        E
Everyone has gone to sleep
G         D       F    C
I'm wide awake on memories
G           Am        C     D#
There memories can't wait.        (Repeat and fade)
