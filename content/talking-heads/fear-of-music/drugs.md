This song is pretty hard to do since there's so much
improvisation in it as well as several guitars dooing
different things. So I only put down the basis here. The
freaking out is up to you...

G                F-G
And all I see is little dots
G                    F-G
Some are smeared and some are spots
D                        C           Bb  G    F-G
Feels like a murder but that's alright
G                      F-G
Somebody said there's too much light
G                      F-G
Pull down the shade and it's alright
D             C       Bb     G    F-G
It'll be over in a minute or two.

E
I'm charged up...Don't put me down
E
Don't feel like talking...Don't mess around
       C             D
I feel mean...I feel O.K.
E
I'm charged up...Electricity

G                    F-G
The boys are making a big mess
G                       F-G
This makes the girls all start to laugh
D                        C        Bb    G   F-G
I don't know what they're talking about
G                       F-G
The boys are worried, the girls are shocked
G                      F-G
They pick the sound and let it drop
D                       C         Bb    G  F-G
Nobody know what they're talking about

E
I'm charged up...I'm kinda wooden
E
I'm barely moving...I study motion
C                         D
I study myself...I fooled myself
E
I'm charged up...It's pretty intense.
E
I'm charged up...Don't put me down
E
Don't feel like talking...Don't mess around
C                    D
I feel mean...I feel O.K.
E
I'm charged up...Electricity.
