C
She had such tiny tears
Bb                 Gm
Just like a Barbie doll
C
She likes to shop at Sears
Bb                 Gm
And visit shopping malls
C
Now she's a big mamma
Tell poppa
Bb        Gm
Cry, cry, cry, cry

Bb   Gm
Old Money
Bb       Gm
Your old money doesn't matter now
Bb   Gm
Have mercy
Bb            Gm
Mercy, mercy, daddy's going fishing now
Bb                C
He put the bait onto his line
Bb                   C
He's winding out his reel
Bb                Gm
Fish are swimming in the pond
Bb                 C
Gonna let 'em sail away
C     |Bb    |Gm   :|
Bb                  Gm
He's got his eye on you
Bb                     C
He knows just what she wants
Bb                Gm
The fish is gonna bite
Bb                C
She is his latest catch
C
'Cause he's Big Daddy
Oh, mammy
C         Gm
Cry, cry, cry, cry

Big Daddy
Oh, daddy's scraping bottom now
Oh, momma
Daddy, daddy, daddy does the talking now
Mesmerized like horny toads
By shiny things like jewels and gold
Throwing all their pearls to swing
Let 'em sail away

You lucky dog
You'll be on Easy Street
Drinking champagne
She gets all that she wants
His heart's desire
No more worries anymore
Like a fairy tale
Anything that she likes
|:C   :|

|:C    |Bb    |Gm   :|
I seen you do the dog
I seen you getting down
A swimming back and forth
When daddy's not around

|:Bb   |Gm   |D#   |C   :|
Big Daddy
Oh, she's pretty as a picture now
Oh, momma
Oh, what a little martyr now
He knows how to drive 'em wild
One day you'd think she'd see
Saying "This is mine and this is her.
Now take that stuff away"

|:C   |Bb  :|
It's best left unspoken
One and one is two
The velvet lies sing softly
Each with a golden spoon
        Bb                      C
And she passed her time in the wind and the rain
      Bb                   C
Got a one way ticket on a Southbound train
      Bb                   C
Said baby, baby, wants to have a good time
    Bb
And Big Daddy laughed
    C
And Big Daddy smiled

|:D#   |C   :|
Like dynamite
One fine day she'll explode
Who's laughing now?
No one sees anymore
Sneak in and out
Don't get caught running 'round
Swim back and forth
Bubbles float to the top
