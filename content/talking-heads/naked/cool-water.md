Day by day ... Whistle while you work ... Our
backs are breaking ...  Up from hollow earth ...
From end to end ... The noise begins ... In the
human battle stations ... And the big one's
coming in

|:Dm   |Gm    :|
Work, work, work, work ... Work till holes are
filled ... Work, work, work, work ... Bags of
bone and skin ...

Lovers hold hands ... Tossing
their heads ... Tangled in hair ... Tied to earth
... With skin and glue

|:G   |D# D   :|
But their skin is the same as yours
Coming in for the world to see
They can sit at the table, too
The same blood as you and me
|:Gm   :|
Dm                   D#               Dm
Speak very softly .. Hold my hand ... Someone is
             D#            Dm
sleeping ... In my bed ... Priests pass by ...
D#                 Dm                   D#
Worms crawl in ... One dreams to be ... One dream for all

|:G   |D# D   :|
His skin is the same as yours
Is he not made the same as you?
And some have fallen down
And blood spilled on the ground

Dm         Gm
Work, work,work, work
Dm               Gm
Till his life is done

The old man .. Is at our door ... And he's

knocking ... knocking ...  
|:D#   |Dm   :|
As his neighbors weep

... Each day repeats ... Are we nothing in your
                                             Gm
eyes? ... Someone answer, someone answer ... This

rusted garden gate ...  Can barely even stand ...
 D#                            Gm
Their work is over now ... And rest will be at

hand

|:G   |D# D   :|
Is their skin not the same as yours?
Can they sit at the table to drink
D#
Cool water
Gm
Cool water
Gm
And his lungs are filled with rain...
And the water's rushing in...

Hey buddy,
Just checking out your tres chic Heads tab site.....not bad.
May I make a suggestion on the Cool Water tab, though? Try using the chords Eb and Gm for the first verse and most of the others....I think you'll find these are a little more accurate.
For the intro, try this:

E------------------------
B---------------------
G-------------------------
D-----------------------
A-----------------6--6-------------6--6-------5--5---------5---5----------5---------
E-----3--3---------------3----------------------------3---------------3----------3---

It's based on an Eb chord and a G5 (or Gm)

...for the "lover's hold hands" bit.....

E-----2------------------
B-----1------------------
G-----2--------------------
D-----1--------------------
A---------------------------
E----(2)------------------

This is some sort of dimished chord, and certainly fits the song. Hook your thumb over the neck for the low E string.

Anyway, hope this helps. All I ask is a little mention somewhere on your page for my small contribution. I'll send you some more additions/suggestions as I have more time.

Thanks for putting together all those chords!
