Bill was a man
              Em A
Who grew too big
                 Em
It didn't matter what he did
The girls would always run away
A
When everybody laughs at you
Em
It can be humiliating

Em
Billy likes a
Cute little girl
They are lovers
We can tell
Gm
Kisses on the mouth
F
Holding hands 'n' all
G#m             G
Look into their eyes...

Sneaking off together
Running to the woods
Swimming in the river
Cooking up some food
Making up religions
Dropping out of school
Laughing through the summertime
Never meant to hurt nobody

Em       A
Angel of God
Em      A

Quiet life

We are not alone...

He bought a gun
And she fixed her dress
"I'm not afraid of Jesus Christ
Who cares about the price we pay"
It's our little secret
And we're never, never, never going

Em
Angel of God

Quiet life
