'Round and 'round
and we won't let go
And where we stop
no one knows
uh-huh uh-huh

Down and down
in a spin we turn
Looking like
we'll never learn
uh-huh uh-huh

Think about
     Bb
what ev'ryone is saying
D          Bb
Ruby dear, oh don't you hear
|:D   |    |Bb   |   :|
Late at night
when the radio is playing
Ruby dear
So looky here

|:C  (Bb) C :|
Oh this record's broken
It slips a beat
And all those watermelons
Have gone to seed

|:D   |    |Bb   |   :|
Nothing lives
in this dirty little river
No one here
Will shed a tear

It dried up
but it couldn't run forever
Ruby dear
That's what we hear

|:C  (Bb):|
I still like the ocean
Down by the sea
They left that door wide open
It tempted me

|:D   |    |Bb   |   :|
Hounding me
from the bedroom to the kitchen

Ruby dear
I'm still right here
Now they throwed
the fox amongst the chickens
It's too deep
I'll drown in my sleep!

|:C  (Bb):|
Angels and prostitutes
They might look the same
And if to Hell we're going
I'll see you there

|:D   :|
C
'Round and 'round
and we won't let go
And where we stop
no one knows
uh-huh uh-huh

Down the street
where the bonfires glow
Looking like
they lost control
uh-huh uh-huh

Settle down
in that rocking chair
Breathing in
that rotten air
uh-huh uh-huh

Johnny Jones
fell fast asleep
Down a hole
where the rocks are steep
uh-huh uh-huh
