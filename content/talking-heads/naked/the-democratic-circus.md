D		Am(+7)		D	         Am(+7)
Found out this morning, there's a circus coming to town
D		Am(+7)		D		     Am(+7)
They drive in Cadillacs, using walky talkies and the secret service
E7	  Asus4  E7	    Asus4
Their big top, imitation of life
E7	    Asus4	E7
and all the flags and microphones
E7			 Asus4
they have to cover their eyes
D	    Am(+7)	    D			Am(+7)
We play the sideshow and we like the tunnel of love
D			Am(+7)		 D		 Am(+7)
And when we ride the ferris wheel, we're little children again

E				Asus4
And when they're asking for volunteers
E			Asus4
we'll be the first one aboard
E			Asus4
And when the ringmaster calls our name
E			  Asus4	    Am(+7)
we'll be the first one to go ... to sleep
D		 Am(+7)	 D	    Am(+7)
Stealing all our dreams, dreams for sale
D			 Am(+7)
They'll sell 'em back to you

D	    Am(+7) D		Am(+7)
On with the show, start the parade
D	  Am(+7) D	   Am(+7)
We sang along, sweep us away
D		Am(+7)		 D			Am(+7)
It's political party time, going down, going down, going down
D		    Am(+7)
And the celebrities all come out
	D			Am(+7)
Coming down coming down, coming ...

The sun is going down and the dogs are starting to howl
We stay out after dark, eating cotton candy and the music's playing ...

How we all laughed
We split our sides
The cameras flashed
We almost died

The rain's gonna poor on down, falling out of the sky
Coming down, coming down
And the celebrities all ran out and the rain's coming down

Gonna rain,
gonna rain, gonna rain
gonna rain, gonna rain
rain, rain
rain, rain

And now I wonder how's boss
and who he's leaving behind?
