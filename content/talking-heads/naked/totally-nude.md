D
Big and I'm bad
And I want you to know
I hand around
Where the grass is greener
Totally naked, baby
Totally nude
'Cause if I want to
A
Who's gonna stop me?
D   A          D
I'm absolutely free
D      A      D
Living in the trees
D           A       D
The birdies and the bees
       A            D
'Cause I'm a nature boy

Locked up inside
You can't tell me where it's at
Open up, open up, open the door
Rocks and trees and physical culture
Some days you hide
I guess you wonder where you are
Nature boy, nature man, take me along
We got a life that's undiscovered

We threw it all away
Throw it all away
Rolling every way
It's irresponsible
So civilized
I guess you wonder where you are
Nature boy, nature man, take me along
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered

D            Em       D          Em
I'm a little fish and you're the river
D           Em          D    Em
Living in a boat that's underwater
       D    Em   D      Em
We can tip, tip, tip it over
        D     Em    D       Em
You can push, push, make it better now
D
Wake your daddy up
It's a quarter to five
Our little boat
    A
Has lost it's rudder
D
Dive to the bottom
And we never come up
A polka party
    A
For Bob and Martha

I'm absolutely free
living in the trees
The birdies and the bees
'Cause I'm a nature boy
Think what you like
This is really where it's at
Open up, open up, open the door
We don't need clothes and we don't need money
So civilized
I guess you wonder where you are
Nature boy, nature man, take me along
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered
