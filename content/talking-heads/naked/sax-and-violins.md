Falling falling
Gonna drop like a stone
I'm falling through the atmosphere
On a warm afternoon
If lovers discover
That ev'ryone dies
So don't tell me, please hole me
It's a dangerous life

|:D   :|
Daddy dear
Let's get outta here
I'm scared
10 o'clock
Nighttime in New York
It's weird

Bm
If you're looking for trouble
                     E
That's what you will find

|:D   (C) D:|
Mom & pop
They will fuck you up
For sure
Love so deep
Kills you in your sleep
It's true

Bm
Love keeps us together
                   E
And love keeps us alive

D    G A D GA D                
And we -    are criminals that never
G A D      Bm
broke no laws
|:D   GA:|
And all - we needed was a net
              E
to break our fall

|:D   :|
Bm
They're searching for diamonds
                    E
They're grabbin' at straws
|:D    :|
Sex 'n' sin
Sax 'n' violins
It's hell
Wooden heads
Furniture with legs
For sale -

Bm
Love keeps us together
                         E
And love will drive us insane
|:D   GA:|
And we - are criminals that never
         Bm
broke no laws
|:D   GA:|
And all - we needed was a net
             E
to break our fall

|:D   :|
Going home
Back where I belong
To stay -
Rays of light
They will turn the light
TO day -

Bm
Birds travel together
                 E
Birds follow the sun
|:D     :|
And I - am watching as the birds go flying home
|:D   C D:|
