I have tried marijuana
I get nervous any time
There will come a knockin' at the door
Why is everybody makin' eyes at me ?
I don't want to know
Excuse and pardon me
Stay for a while
Maybe we'll never
meet again

Am                    G
I can see my lifetime piling up
Am                           G
I can see the days turn into nights
Am                   G
I can see the people on the street
           Am                
Open those windows up
G
- A hundred floors below me
Am           G
Pilin' those houses up
            Am              G
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher
                Am               G
I can feel them swayin' back and forth
            Am
Building it higher, higher
  G
- This tower's learning over

|:Am    |    G:|
I got bad coordination
Stuck a pencil in my eye
I can hardly wait to get back home
Why is everybody gettin' paranoid ?
I's only havin' fun
Scum bags and superstars
Tell me your names
I'll make a bet, you're
both the same

Am                    G
I can see my lifetime pilin' up
Am                       G
Reaching from my bedroom to the stars
Am                        G
I can see the house where I was born
            Am           G
When I was growin' up... they say that
              Am               G
I could never keep my trousers up
           Am             G
I remember days and crazy nights
              Am              G
Are there any pirates on this ship ?
            Am         G
And if they sober up - they have us

Home by morning

|:Em   :|
          F
Cry, cry, cry
                  Am
It's just you and I -
              Em
Like an automobile
                   Am
with no one at the wheel
                F
Spinning out of control
                   Am
We're all over the road
               Em
In our sexy machine
All the passengers scream
Scream, scream !


|:Am   |G   :|
I can see my lifetime pilin' up
I can see it smashin' into yours
It was not as accident at all
Open those windows up - I hear you laughin'

Goin' from the bottom to the top
Maybe I'm holding on too tight
And now I'm foldin' up
I got a funny feeling
Pilin' them houses up
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher
Building that highway to the stars
Turning the music up - Hey!
I got a winning number
