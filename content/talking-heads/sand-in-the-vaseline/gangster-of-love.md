Am          Em
Gangster of love
            Am
Gangster of love
             Em
You with the cocktail in your hand
            Am
You in your red Mercedes Benz
      Em
Goin' in one ear and out the other
Am
cover up the pain with laughter, baby
Em
I'm not laughing
Am
I'm not laughing

G
Hey Al Capone
F
Is that who you think you are?
Em
All the girls

All around the world
      D
Well, they wanna shake your hand
G
It won't be long
F
You'll need an alibi
Em
A little bird
Told me what he'd heard
D
Is it really true?

They're gonna take you for a ride
And hit you right between the eyes
You can hear the pretty music playin' well
listen to the words, they're saying,
you can hear them calling', hear them calling'

G
Hey, Al Capone
F
You'll need a bodyguard
Em
Just like that
You'll be laid out flat
D
With a broken heart
G
I shot you down
F
Who's gonna help you now?
Em
Valentine's day
Better hope and pray
           D
They'll be tearing you apart
            Em
Gangster of love, Gangster of love
Gangster of love, Gangster of love

Em
I hear conversations
Am
In restaurants and bars
  Em
I read all the papers
    Am
And what they say is wrong
       D
It's such a fine, fine line
such a fine, fine line
