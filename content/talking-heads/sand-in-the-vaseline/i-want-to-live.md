Am             F           G
I want to live, to feel a face
            Am
that isn't there
Am              F
I want to live
        G                  Am
I roll over and you're not there
E                          F
I'm only standing on the shore
E                             F      G   |:F   |C   |G  :|
I had some friends but I want more       mmmmm

F         C   Am            G
I see the future and it's all mine
F          C  Am                  G
Want to be perfect, I'm taking my time
F                                   C
I'll try not to act like I'm so far away
F                               C
I try to be right in whatever I say
F                      C
Deeper feelings recur again & again & again & again
F                               C
A complex spiral leads me to spin...

Am              F
I want to live
           G                   Am
To see the earth turn one more time
Am            F
I wanna live
          G               Am
To feel a hand that isn't mine
E                        F
I'm only standing on the shore
E                         F        |G    |G    |
I had some fun but I want more
F                              C
I'll try not to act like I'm so far away
F                               C
I try to be right in whatever I say
F                             C
Deeper feelings recur again & again & again & again
F                            C
A complex spiral leads me to spin...

Mmmm...
