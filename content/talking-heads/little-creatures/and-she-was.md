E           A            E
And she was lying in the grass
              A                E
And she could hear the highway breathing
              A            E
And she could see a nearby factory
             A               E
She's making sure she is not dreaming
Bb      F           G          F
See the lights of a neighbor's house
Bb        C           F
Now she's starting to rise
Bb     F         G     F
Take a minute to concentrate
        Bb    G       C
And she opens up her eyes


E             A                  D           A                E   |A  |D  |A
The world was moving and she was right there with it (and she was)
E             A                D       A                E
The world was moving she was floating above it (and she was)
|A   |D   |A         E   |:A    |E    :|
             and she was

|:A   |E   :|
And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth
Bb     F        C   F
Moving into the universe
Bb       C            F
Drifting this way and that
Bb    F      C         F
Not touching ground at all
Bb  G        C
Up above the yard

CHORUS

Bm
She was glad about it... no doubt about it
G
She isn't sure where she's gone
Bm
No time to think about what to tell them
G
No time to think about what she's done
        E  A  |:E   |A   :|
And she was

|:E   |A   :|
And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She's moving out in all directions

CHORUS

Joining the world of missing persons (and she was)
Missing enough to feel alright (and she was)
