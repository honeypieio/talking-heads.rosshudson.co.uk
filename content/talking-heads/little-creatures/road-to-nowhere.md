WELL WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOIN'
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'VE BEEN
AND WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE KNOWIN'
BUT WE CAN'T SAY WHAT WE'VE SEEN
AND WE'RE NOT LITTLE CHILDREN
AND WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT
AND THE FUTURE IS CERTAIN
GIVE US TIME TO WORK IT OUT


E
We're on a road to nowhere
C#m
Come on inside
E
Takin' that ride to nowhere
C#m
We'll take that ride


A
I'm feelin' okay this mornin'
E       B
And you know,
A                        E
We're on the road to paradise
        B           E
Here we go, here we go

CHORUS

E
We're on a ride to nowhere
C#m
Come on inside
E
We're taking that ride to nowhere
C#m
We'll take that ride

A                          E
Maybe you wonder where you are
        B
I don't care
A                            E
Here is where time is on our side
         B                E
Take you there...take you there

E                           C#m
We're on a road to nowhere
E                           C#m
We're on a road to nowhere
E                           C#m
We're on a road to nowhere

E
There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
             C#m
and it's all right, baby, it's all right
E
And it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
             C#m
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
E
They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
             C#m
And it's all right, baby, it's all right

E                           C#m   (repeat)
We're on a road to nowhere
