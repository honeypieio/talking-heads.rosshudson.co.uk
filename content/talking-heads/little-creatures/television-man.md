I'm looking and I'm dreaming for the first time
I'm inside and I'm outside at the same time
E                 A
And everything is real
E                   A
Do I like the way I feel?

When the world crashes in into my living room
Television man made me what I am
People like to put the television down
    E       B        A
But we are just good friends
        E   B      A
(I'm a) television man

I knew a girl, she was a macho man
But it's alright, I wasn't fooled for long
E                     A
This is the place for me
E                 A
I'm the king, and you're the queen

CHORUS

C                  G         F
Take a walk in the beautiful garden
C                       G    F
Everyone would like to say hello
Dm                 A
It doesn't matter what you say
E             A   B  C#m
Come and take us away    hey hey

na na na na na na etc

The world crashes in, into my living room
The world crashes in, into my living room
The world crashes in, into my living room
The world crashes in, into my living room

And we are still good friends...(Television man)
I'm watching everything...(Television man)
Television man...(Television man)
I'm watching everything...(Television man)
Television man...and I'm gonna say
We are still good friends...and I'm trying to be
Watchin' everything...and I gotta say
We are still good friends...You know the way it is
Television man...I've got what you need
We are still good friends...I know the way you are
Television man...I know what you're tryin' to be
Watchin' everything...and I gotta say
That's how the story ends.
