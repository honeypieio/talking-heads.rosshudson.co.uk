It's okay to be afraid
When the blue sparks hit your brain
We can love one another
I've been told that it's okay

Doctor, doctor, tell me what I am
Am I one of those human beings
Well I can laugh or I can learn to think
So help me now to find out what I feel

A man can drive his car
And a woman can be a boss

If they decide to they'll make little creatures
Watch 'em now!
