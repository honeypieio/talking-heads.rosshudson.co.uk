C#m
There's a word for it
Dm
And words don't mean a thing
C#m
There's name for it
Dm
And names make all the difference in the world
Gm
Some things can never be spoken
D#
Some things cannot be pronounced
G                  A
That word does not exist in any language
        D                     F             Am
It will never be uttered by a human mouth

Let breath pass through those cracked lips
That man was my hero
And now that word has been taken from us
