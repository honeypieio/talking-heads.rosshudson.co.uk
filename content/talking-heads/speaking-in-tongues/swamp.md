Am                        C
Now lemme tell you a story
Am                    C
The devil he has a plan
Am                          C
A bag a' bones in his pocket
Am                 D Am
Got anything you want
   C   Am       C   Am
No dust and no rocks
              C Am
The whole thing is over
                 C Am            C Am
All these beauties in solid motion
                 C Am        D        Am
All those beauties, gonna swallow you up

Am
Hi hi hi hi hi,
     One time too many
     Too far to go
     I- We come to take you home

(as above)
And when they split those atoms
It's hotter than the sun
Blood is a special substance
They gonna pray for that man

So wake up young lovers
The whole thing is over
Watch but touch monkeys
All that blood, gonna swallow you whole

Hi hi hi hi hi
     What's that?  Who's driving?
     Where we goin'?  Who knows?
     I- We come to take you home

     D              C  D             C
     How many people do you think I am
        D                     C
     Pretend I am somebody else
     D              C D                    C D
     You can pretend I'm and old millionaire
     D                               C
     A millionaire washing his hands
     D               C D                    C
     Rattle the bones, dreams that stick out
       D                        C Bm D
     A medical chart on the wall
     D            C    D                      C
     Soft violence and hands touch your throat
     D                      C
     Ev'ryone wants to explode

Am              C am         C
And when your hands get dirty
Am           C  Am        C Am
Nobody knows you at all
Am                              C  Am
Don't have a window to slip out of
Am          C      Am
Lights on, nobody home

(as above)
Click click- see ya later
Beta beta- no time to rest
Pika pika- risky business
All that blood, will never cover that mess.

     What's that, who's driving
     No tricks lets go
     I- We come to take you home

Hi hi hi hi hi
etc.
