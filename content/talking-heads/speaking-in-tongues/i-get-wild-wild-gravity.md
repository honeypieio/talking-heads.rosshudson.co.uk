Fooled around enough with numbers
Let's not be ourselves today
Is it just my imagination
Is it just someone's fave
     Pleasantly out of proportion
     It's hard to hold on to the ground
     Now I didn't come to run
     And this is everything
     And gravity lets you down

|:Bm   :|
I get wild, wizing up
  I just can't let go
I get wild  when I get ready
  I can hardly talk
Living lights
Special lights
Yellow turns blue
I get wild  It's automatic
  I can hardly move

|:Bm   |   Bm+9 Bm:|
     Go ahead and pull the curtains
     Check to see if I'm still here
     Let me lose my perspective
     Something worth waiting for
     Somewhere in South Carolina
     And gravity don't mean a thing
     And all around the world
     Each and ev'ryone
     Playing with a heart of steel

|:Bm    :|
I get up climbing out
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Beautiful
Beautiful
Climbing up the wall
I get by on automatic
No surprise at all

|:Bm   |   Bm+9 Bm:|
     No one here can recognize you
     Here is ev'rything that you like
     Feelings without explanations
     Somethings are hard to describe
     The sound of a cigarette burning
     A place there where ev'rything spins
     And the sounds inside your mind
     Is playing all the time
     Playing with a heart of steel

I get wild, wizing up
  I just can't let go
I get wild  when I get ready
  I can hardly talk
Red 'n' white  black to gold
Yellow turns blue
I get wild  It's automatic
  I can hardly move

I get up pushing up
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Shut the door
Shut the door
Climbing up the wall
I get by on automatic
No surprise at all
