Hello again

     I feel nice when I sing this song
     And I don't mind
     Whatever happens is fine
F#
Baby likes to keep on playing . . .

F#
Wilder than the place we live in . . .
Bbm  
     I'll take you there, I'll take you there
F#
I don't mind some slight disorder . . .
Bbm
     Pull up the roots pull up the roots
F#

Towns that dissapeared completely . . .
     Pull up the roost, pull up the roots
Miles and miles of endless highway . . .
     Pull up the roost, pull up the roots
Colored lights and shiney curtains . . .
     I'll take you there, I'll take you there
Ev'rything has been forgiven . . .
     Pull up the roost, pull up the roots

     Well I have a good time . . . when I go out of my mind
     And it's a wonderful place . . . and I can't wait to be there
     And I hear beautiful sounds . . . coming outa the ground
     Gonna take us a while . . . but we'll go hundreds of times
