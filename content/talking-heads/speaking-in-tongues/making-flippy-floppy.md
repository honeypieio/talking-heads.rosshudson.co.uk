Everybody: get in line

Fm7
Nothing can come between us
Nothin gets you down
Nothing strikes your fancy
Nothing turns you on
     Somebody is waiting in the hallway
     Somebody is falling down the stairs
     Set someone free, break someone's heart
     Stand up  help us out

Ev'rything is divided
Nothing is complete
Ev'rything looks impressive
Do not be deceived
     You don't have to wait for more instructions
     No one makes a monkey out of me
     We lie on our backs, feet in the air
     Rest and relaxation, rocket to my brain
F
Snap into position
          G               F    Am G
          Bounce till you ache
F
Step out of line
            G               F    Am G
         And you end up in jail
F
Bring me a doctor
                  G          F    Am G
         I have a hole in my head
F
But they are just people
             G         F    Am G
         And I'm not afraid

   Doctor Doctor
We have nothing in our pockets
We continue
But we have nothing left to offer
     Faces pressed against the window
     Hey! they are just my friends
     Check this out  don't be slick
     Break our backs  it goes like this . . .

     G                          F    Am G
          From the cold and the rain
F
We're in no hurry
     G                 F   Am G
          sugar and spice
F
We sing in the darkness
     G                 F    Am G
          We poen our eyes (open up)

     G                       F     Am G

F
Divide it in sections
     G                      F     Am G
          And then give it away
F
There are no big secrets
     G                           F     Am G
          Don't believe what you read
