Another one chord song (how do they do it!)

A TERRIBLE SIGNAL
TOO WEAK TO EVEN RECOGNIZE
A GENTLE COLLAPSING
THE REMOVAL OF THE INSIDES

I'M TOUCHED BY YOUR PLEAS
I VALUE THESE MOMENTS
WE'RE ORDER THAN WE REALIZE
...IN SOMEONE'S EYES

A FREQUENT RETURNING
AND LEAVING UNNOTICED
A CONDITION OF MERCY
A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER

A VIEW TO REMEMBER
THE CENTER IS MISSING
THEY QUESTION HOW THE FUTURE LIES
...IN SOMEONE'S EYES
THE GENTLE COLLAPSING
OF EVERY SURFACE
WE TRAVEL ON THE QUIET ROAD
...THE OVERLOAD
