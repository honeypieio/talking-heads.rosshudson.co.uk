It seems like the basis of the verses exists only by the A7sus4 chord.
Around this chord the rhythm section is playing along with the bass
playing the |:F  A  |F  A  :| part. When playing the song on guitar
without a band you can make the verses less boring by playing the bass
part on the guitar...

And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself-Well...How did I get here?

D                              G
Letting the days go by/let the water hold me down
D                             G
Letting the days go by/water flowing underground
D                             G
Into the blue again/after the money's gone
D                        G
Once in a lifetime/water flowing underground.

And you may ask yourself
How do I work this?
And you may ask yourself
Where is that large automobile?
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful house!
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful wife!

Water dissolving...and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Carry the water at the bottom of the ocean
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean!

Under the rocks and stones/there is water underground.

And you may ask yourself
What is that beautiful house?
And you may ask yourself
Where does that highway go?
And you may ask yourself
Am I right?...Am I wrong?
And you may tell yourself
MY GOD!...WHAT HAVE I DONE?
