Mojique, sees his village from a nearby hill
Mojique, thinks of days before Americans came
He sees the foreigners in growing numbers
He sees the foreigners in fancy houses
He thinks of days that he can still remember... now

Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands
Mojique sends the package to the American man
Sofly he glides along the streets and alleys
Up comes the wind that makes them run forever
he feels the time is surely now or never... more

The wind in my heart (2x)
The dust in my head (2x)
The wind in my heart (2x)
(come to) drive them away (2x)

Mojique buys equipment in the market place
Mojique plants devices in the free trade zone
He feels the wind is lifting up his people
He calls the wind to guide him on his mission
He knows his friend the wind is always standing... by

Mojique smells the wind that comes from far away
Mojique waits for news in a quiet place
He feels the presence of the wind around him
He feels the power of the wind behind him
He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him... on
