A                              C                 A
I was born in a house with the television always on
             F
Guess I grew up too fast
         G
And I forgot my name
         A                   C
We're in cities at night and we got time on our hands.
             F
So leave the driving to us.
             G
And it's the real thing.

            C
And you're rolling
       D
In the blender
     C
With me.
And I can love you
       D
Like a color
C
TV.

A                 D
Now love is here
          E
C'mon and try it
      A             D
I got love for sale
    E
Got love for sale
        A             D
And now love is here
          E
C'mon and try it
    A              D
Got love for sale,
    E
Got love for sale.

You can put your lipstick all over my designer jeans.
          F
I'll be a video for you.
       G
If you turn my dial.
A                            C              A
You can cash my check if you go down to the bank
        F
You get two for one
       G
For a limited time.

C               D
Push my button...
               C
The toast pops up
                D
Love and money

Gettin' all
      C
Mixed up

I got love for sale

I got love for sale
I got Love


SUSAN FAY SENT ME THE FOLLOWING ADDITION:


here's what I figured out for the main riff off Love 4 Sale. I hope you
could use this:

Love For Sale(main riff)
by David Byrne
album: True stories

e-4h5-5-5-5-5-5-5-7h8-8-8-8-8-8-8-7-5
b-4h5-5-5-5-5-5-5-7h8-8-8-8-8-8-8-7-5

e------------------------------------

THANK YOU SUSAN!


Thanks for taking the time to write out all that great Talking Heads music.  I totally appreciate it, especially on the earlier, more obscure songs.  As a way of saying thanks, I thought I would just pass this along:

For the song Love For Sale, Susan Fay sent in a tab showing part of the "main riff".  

The notes she indicated are actually the bottom two notes of an E-shaped bar chord, played on the fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth frets.  

To play the song, just slide an E-shaped bar chord from the fourth fret to the fifth fret;  then slide from the seventh to the eighth fret;  and then play the seventh fret and the fifth fret.  That creates the A - C - A progression heard in the line "I was born in a house with the television always on."  Then you can just move the same bar chord down to the first fret to play the F, and to the third fret to play the G, which gives you the music for "I grew up too fast and I forgot my name."  

I hope this is helpful.  Thanks again for all your hard work.

Brad
