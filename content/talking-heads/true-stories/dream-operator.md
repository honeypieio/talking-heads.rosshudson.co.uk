C
When you were little
    Em
You dreamed you were big
    F
You must have been something
A real tiny kid
    C
You wish you were me
  Em
I wish I was you
    F
Now don't you wake up
                    G
The dream will come true

      C            F   G
Every dream has a name
    C                G
And names tell your story
      C            F   G
This song is your dream
           C         G
You're the dream operator

C
It's bigger than life
    Em
You know it's all me
   F
My face is a book
But it's not what it seems
      C
Three angels above
    Em
The whole human race
     F
They dream us to life
                G
They dream me a face

          C              F  G
And every dream tells it all
    C                  G
And this dream is your story
    C             F   G
You dreamed me a heart
           C         G
You're the dream operator

Shake-it-up dream
Hi-di-ho dream
Fix-it-up dream
Look at me dream
I've been waiting so long
Now I am your dream

C
Hard to forget
Em
Hard to go on
     F
When you fall asleep
You're out on your own
C
Let go of your life
Em
Grab on to my hand
F
Here in the clouds
                  G
Where we'll understand

    C              F  G
And you dreamed it all
    C            G
And this is your story
       C             F  G
Do you know who you are?
           C         G
You're the dream operator
