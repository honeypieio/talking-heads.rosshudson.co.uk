Every night sun goes down
And the people are staying at home
You can tell your momma & daddy
Leave those children alone

They know what they're doin'
They ain't runnin' away
Uncle John said, "Tell Aunt Mary
I got nothing to say"
(And she say:)

Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now now!
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now now!
