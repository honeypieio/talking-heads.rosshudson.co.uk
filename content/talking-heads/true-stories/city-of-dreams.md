G                          C D
Here where you are standing,   the dinosaus did a dance
G                       C D
The indians told a story,  now it has come to pass
C                       G D
The Indians had a legend,  the Spaniards lived for gold
C                        G                      D
The white man came and killed them   but they haven't really gone

CHORUS
G              D       C
We live in the city of dreams
G               D          C
We drive on the highway of fire
Am                  C
Should we awake and find it gone
D
Remember this our favourite town


From Germany and Europe and southern USA
They made this little town here that we live in till this day
The children of the white man saw Indians on TV
And heard about the legend how their city was a dream

CHORUS

The Civil War is over and World War I and II
If we can live together, the dream it might come true
underneath the concrete the dream is still alive
A hundred milion lifetimes, a world that never dies

CHORUS
