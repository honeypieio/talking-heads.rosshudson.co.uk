"There's nothing on tonight", he said, "I don't know

	GO ON AS ABOVE
We've heard this little scene, we've heard it many times.
People fighting over little things and wasting precious time.
They might be better off ... I thing ... the way it seems to me.
Making up their own shows, which might be better than T.V.

(CHORUS)
|:Em   G      Em  G      Em      G   Em G:|
Judy's in the bedroom, inventing situations.
Em     G      Em       D     Em      G    Em  G
Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations.
Em         G     Em          A
They've enlisted all their family.
Em         G     Em         D
They've enlisted all their friends.
   Em            D      Em     D
It helped saved their relationship,
    Em       D     E
And made it work again ...

|:Gm   |     |C     |     :|
Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit.
There might even be a spinoff, but they're not sure 'bout that.
If they ever watch T.V. again, it'd be too soon for them.
Bob never yells about the picture now, he's having
   too much fun.

(CHORUS)

Judy's in the bedroom, inventing situations,
Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations.
They've enlisted all their family.
They've enlisted all their friends.
It helped save their relationship,
And made it work again ...

So think about this little scene; apply it to you life.
If your work isn't what you love, then something isn't right.
Just look at Bob and Judy; they're happy as can be,
Inventinting situations, putting them on T.V.

(CHORUS)

Judy's in the bedroom, inventing situations.
Dod is on the street today, scouting up locations.
They've enlisting all their family.
They've enlisted all their friends.
It helped save the relationship,
And made it work again ...


Hey guys, your chords are wrong for Found a Job (More Songs...)
>From "More Songs...", If the 1st chord is A7, then it goes (line by line):
A7
A7
D7
A7
(repeat for 2nd verse)
CHORUS:
E A E G
E A E G
E D E D
E A E G
E G E A (Em G Em A)
E G A F# (Em G A F#)
B D B D
B D E _

And so on. The Stop Making Sense (movie) version is slightly different. It
sounds like the 5th chorus verse has chords E G D A instead of E G E A (or
the Em equivalent).
Yours
