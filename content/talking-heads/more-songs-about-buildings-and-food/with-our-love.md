|:Gm Am  |Bbm   |
|Gm  Am  |Gm   :|
It's just a look, and it makes the boys quiver.
Yes, it's just the look, and now they remember.
C#m         Bm         C#m           Bm
Had they forgotten ... what this all means?
|:Gm Am  |Bbm   |
|Gm  Am  |Gm   :|
I think they want to forget,
And they hope that this time.

(CHORUS)
|:A   |E   :|2x
I won't look,
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
I've got other things to do now.
|:A   |E   :|2x
I forgot what it was,
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
I've got to get to work now.
|:A   |E   :|2x
(And they) set an example for us (I see it!).
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
It can happen to me too.
|:A   |E   :|2x
(And it) didn't make any difference to us (But I)
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.
|:Gm  |A   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.
|:Am  Em  :|
With our love, With our love, WITH OUR LOVE

|:Gm Am  |Bbm   |
|Gm  Am  |Gm   :|
They hear the words, such as "You're really special"
(And they) can't face the feeling.
(And they) can't really tell
I look out the window,
(And I) I call that education.
(And I) See all my friends standing out there
(And I) I call that education (sophistication)

C#m           Bm            C#m         Bm
Things got so busy and they won't be offended
|:Gm Am  |Bbm   |
|Gm  Am  |Gm   :|
Things come and go (and I see 'em)
And I wont be neglected (not this time!)

(REPEAT CHORUS)

AND THIS VERSION MIGHT BE BETTER THAN MY INTERPRETATION:

Why would I be writing if I thought the tab was correct?  Why am I writing
at all?  I don't know.  So, here is what I hear:

(CHORUS)
|:A   |E   :|2x
I won't look,
|:G   |E   :|2x
I've got other things to do now.
|:A   |E   :|2x
I forgot what it was,
|:G   |E   :|2x
I've got to get to work now.
|:A   |E   :|2x
(And they) set an example for us (I see it!).
|:G   |E   :|2x
It can happen to me too.
|:A   |E   :|2x
(And it) didn't make any difference to us (But I)
|:G   |E   :|2x
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.
|:G   |E   :|2x

Everywhere you had a |Gm  A|, I think it's really |G  E|
Sounds right when I play it.

Then, this part below.  I don't know the name of the chord, so I called it
Am-3 because you're removing the 3rd note in the AM Scale (the C).
Played on the 12th fret, this seems to be correct:

|:Am  Am-3  :|
With our love, With our love, WITH OUR LOVE

So you'd be playing Am, and lifting the C, which would be the 13th fret on
the B string.

And of course the intro is/seems to be:

G   - A   - Bb   |  x2
A   - Bb -C     |  x2
Bb - C  -Db    |  x2

All on the G-string, single notes, NOT CHORDS.

This seems to be more correct.
