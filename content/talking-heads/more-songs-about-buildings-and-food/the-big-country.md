I see the shapes,
I remember from maps.
I see the shoreline.
I see the whitecaps.
A baseball diamond, nice weather down there.
I see the school and the houses where the kids are.
Places to park by the fac'tries and buildings.
                                            |C6
Restaunts and bar for later in the evening.
                              F                        G  C6
Then we come to the farmlands, and the undeveloped areas.
                         F                          G    C6
And I have learned how these things work together.
                 F                              G  C6
I see the parkway  that passes through them all.
                  F                                 G      Bb
And I have learned  how to look at these things and I say,

(CHORUS)
Bb         F                   Eb
I wouldn't live there if you paid me.
Bb         F               Eb
I couldn't live like that, no siree!
Bb         F                Eb
I couldn't do the things the way those people do.
Bb         F                 Eb
I couldn't live there if you paid me to.

|:C   |D   |F   |   G  :|
I guess it's healthy, I guess the air is clean.
I guess those people have fun with their neighbors and friends.
Look at that kitchen and all of that food.
Look at them eat it' guess it tastes real good.

(CHORUS)

I say, I wouldn't live there if you paid me.
I couldn't live like that, no siree!
I couldn't do the things the way those people do.
I wouldn't live there if you paid me to.

|:C   |D   |F   |   G  :|
I'm tired of looking out the windows of the airplane
I'm tired of travelling, I want to be somewhere.
It's not even worth talking
About those people down there.

My name is Bill Carlin and I'm writing to you about the Talking
Heads song "The Big County".It's missing a few lines on the lyrics
sheet.I don't know the musical notation because I'm not a musican
but I can give the lyrics.They come after the lines:Look at them eat
it'guess it tastes real good.Her are the missing lyrics:
They grow it in those farmlands.
Then they bring it to the store.
They put it in their car trunk.
And they bring it back home.
And I say
(CHORUS)
    If you notice on the present sheet,you have (CHORUS) after"it tastes
real good.",where,in fact,you have written the complete chorus
afterwards.I think you wrote the entire chorus instead of the missing
lyrics on the present sheet.You can put the musical notation by listening to
that part of the song.I hope this information helps you.
I will be looking for this correction in the near future.



                                        Sincerly,
