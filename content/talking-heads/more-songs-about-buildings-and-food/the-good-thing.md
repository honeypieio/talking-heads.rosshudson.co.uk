I will fight; will fight with my heart.
I will fight; will fight with understanding.
In my mind, the weather never changes
Skill overcomes, difficult situations.

A                C             D          F
A straight line exists between me and the good things.
A                 C               D         F
I have found the line and its direction is known to me.
A                        C           D         F
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction.
A                C          D                 F
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing.

Try to compare what I am presenting.
You will meet with much frustration.
Try to find ... similar situation.
You will always find the same solution.

As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied.
Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction.
As we economise, efficiency is multiplied,
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing.
So I say:
Gm                       F
I have adopted this and made it my own:
Gm                          F
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.
Gm                       F
I have adopted this and made it my own:
Gm                          F
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong.
