In...my...sensations
E7
I believe that I...was
D7                          Am(+6)
born with the things that I know
Em           Am
I want...to talk...
        Dm
Like ev'ry
         Am             D
Before I decide what to do
       G        Dm        G              Dm
And I fell all over and I couldn't stand up
  G        Dm         G           Dm

I'm...only...looking
            E7     D7                  Am(+6)
Feel like my heart has a will of it's own

And now it's...summer again
    G            Dm        G            Dm
The story that I told, The story I made up
      G          Dm        G           Dm

Some density moved right beside me
Em          Am             Dm

But now I'm  far away
   G         Dm       G               Dm
