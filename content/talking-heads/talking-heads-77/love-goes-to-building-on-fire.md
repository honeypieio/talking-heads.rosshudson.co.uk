I've got two loves
And make 'em tweet tweet tweet like little birds
I've got two loves
Two loves, two loves
Which is my face

When my love, stands next to your love
I can't define love, when it's not love

It's not love
It's not love
Which is my face
Which is a building
Which is on fire - on fire
