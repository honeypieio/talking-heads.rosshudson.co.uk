E         A         B   A
I wish you wouldn't say that
E                     A          B A
I thought I'd have to come right over
E          A        B     A
I thought I made it clear enough
E                    A       B   A
I guess I'll have to make it clearer

E
Say something to change your mind
E
Bring me back the way I used to be
E
If it takes forever that's all right
E
Say the words that I've been trying to hear

I wish you didn't tell her
I thought O'd have to come right over
I thought I'd have to make it clearer
Now Jimmy's coming over

|:E    :|
There are places that I won't forget
And I guess I'm never going back
Guess it's information that I lack
I've told lies without a hint or regret

|:E   |A   B :|
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that...
E
