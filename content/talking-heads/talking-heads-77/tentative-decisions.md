Now that I can
Release my tensions
Let me make clear
My best intentions
Girls ask and I
define decision
Boys ask and I
describe their function

        C   FC
Oh the boys want to talk
           F                G
Like to to talk about those problems
        C         FC
And the girls say they're concerned
             F                    G
And they are concerned with these decisions
          C             FC
And it's all hard Logic
                  F         G
To follow and the girls get lost
        C        FC
And the boys say they're concerned
            F                     G
But they are concerned with these decisions

         C
I wanna talk
                D
I wanna talk as much as I want
          C
I'm gonna give
                   D
I'm gonna give the problem to you
         C
I wanna talk
                D
I wanna talk as much as I want
          C
I'm gonna give
                   D
I'm gonna give the problem to you
G
Decide, decide
Make up your mind
Decide, decide
I told you what to say
Confuse, confuse
Describe what I found
Confuse, confuse
I told you what to say
