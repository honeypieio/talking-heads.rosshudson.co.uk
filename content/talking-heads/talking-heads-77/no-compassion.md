Bm       Bm
In a world
                  E
where people have problems
Bm
In this world
                             E
where decisions are a way of life
Bm                                        E
Other people's problems they overwhelm my mind
Bm                                                    E
They say compassion is a virtue, but I don't have the time

So many people...have their problems
I'm not interested...in their problems
I guess I've...experienced some problems
But now I've...made some decisions
D              F  D F D              A G D A G D
Takes a lot of time to push away the nonsense

Take my compassion...Push it as far as it goes

My interest level's dropping, my interest level is dropping

I've heard all I want to, I don't want to hear any more

What are you, in love with your problems?
I think you take it...a little too far
It's...not so cool to have so many problems
But don't expect me to explain your indecisions


D                   F  D F D                       A G D A G D
Go...talk to your analyst, isn't that what they're paid for

You walk, you talk...You still function like you used to

It's not a question...Of your personality or style

Be a little more selfish, it might do you some good

(as verse one)

In a world where people have problems
In this world where decisions are a way of life
Other people's problems, they overwhelm my mind
They say compassion is a virtue, but I don't have the time
(Here we go again)
