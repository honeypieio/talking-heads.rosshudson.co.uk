C                          A
I see the clouds that move across the sky
C                             A
I see the wind that moves the clouds away
G                   F           Am
It moves the clouds over by the building
G                        F         Am
I pick the building that I want to live in

(CHORDS AS ABOVE)
I smell the pine trees and the peaches in the woods
I see the pinecones that fall by the highway
That's the highway that goes to the building
I pick the building that I want to live in

C                     F    G
It's over there, it's over there
D               G
My building has every convenience
D                    G
It's gonna make life easy for me
D                     G
It's gonna be easy to get things done
D             G
I will relax alone with my loved ones

E                      D
Loved ones, loved ones visit the building,
         E                 D
take the highway, park and come up and see me
         E                   D
I'll be working, working but If you come visit
         E                       D
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important

C                 A
I see the states, across this big nation
C                      A
I see the laws made in Washington, D.C.
G                     F           Am
I think of the ones I consider my favorites
G                              F           Am
I think of the people that are working for me

(CHORDS AS ABOVE)
Some civil servants are just like my loved ones
They work so hard and they try to be strong
I'm a lucky guy to live in my building
They own the buildings to help them along
