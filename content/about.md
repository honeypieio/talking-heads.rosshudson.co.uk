This is the new skin of a long gone site that has been offline since the early 2000s. It contains a **massive** collection of almost every Talking Heads song, as well as several songs by David Byrne, Tom Tom Club and The Heads. All of this was created by **just one person**  - an archived copy of the original site can be found on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20021104221804/people.a2000.nl/hazijder/).

The goal of this new site is to:  

1. Make this amazing work available again
2. Add missing entries - a lot of material has been released since the old site closed!
3. Improve/correct the original entries wherever needed
