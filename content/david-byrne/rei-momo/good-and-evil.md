Bm
Caught you walking' like a gangster
A                       Bm
Saw you grabbin' the controls
Now you're almost outta batteries
A                         Bm
You gotta sweater much to small
Bm6           Bm
Pokin' at your navel
Bm6           Bm
Pointin' your finger too
C#6
You say your lips don't even stick together
         E          Bm
When the dust comes up
Bm6                Bm
Blowin' 'cross the plains
C#6                                
Pictures fallin' in and outta their frames!


Bm
Good and evil, good and evil
A                           Bm
They turned 'em loose, they turned into people
Good and evil, good and evil
A                           Bm
They turned 'em loose, they turned into people
              F#
You know that roses and lilacs are funky too?
Bm
Let 'em go at it, let's see what they do
F#
Now we're wrestlin' with the forces of good and evil
Bm
They turned 'em loose, they turned into people

Bm
I have seen you do thing backward
A                          Bm
You don't believe a word I say
Now you're holdin' sticky paper
A                 Bm
Money never fades away

Bm6            Bm
Talkin' like a monster
Bm6             Bm
Smellin' like a baby
C#m6
You got a head like a bowl full of cherries
E               Bm
Now don't be surprised
Bm6
You go what it takes
C#m6
Messin' round like monkeys and apes

Bm
Good and evil, good and evil
A                           Bm
They turned 'em loose, they turned into people
Good and evil, good and evil
A                           Bm
They turned 'em loose, they turned into people
              F#
You know that roses and lilacs are funky too?
Bm
Let 'em go at it, let's see what they do
F#          
Now we're wrestlin' with the forces of good and evil
