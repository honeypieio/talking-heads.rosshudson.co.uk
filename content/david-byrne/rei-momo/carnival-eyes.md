      Dm
Gone away
         Am
Someone else son's gone
       Dm
What a day
     C
For dreaming
Dm
Hard hurt heart
     Am
The holds the door
Dm
Buried in time
   Am
In hallways bleeding

Dm                    F
And all the time they walk in line
Dm                  F
And all the time in asking land
A
Who's that girl
            Dm
Who like to dance all day?
A                   C
Beauty is always so strange


E        C
Carnival girl
A              Am          E     C  A  C
Where do those eyes come from?
E         C
What is inside there?
A      C     E     C A Am
So far away


    Dm
Any day
     Am
When soldiers come
      Dm
Woman pray
  C
I lie here
Dm
There's a flame
      Am
Whose light still shines
Dm
Leading us on
        F          
Through fields and bridges


    Dm                C
And all the time they walk the line
    Dm               C
And all the time in asking land
A
I've seen grasses grow
        Dm
Through rock and stone
A                   C
Nature is always so strange


E        C
Carnival girl
A              Am         E      C  A  C
Where do those eyes come from?
E         C
What is inside there?
A       C      E  C  A  Am
So far away

|:Dm   |Am   :|

    Dm               C
And all the time they walk the line
    Dm               C
And all the time in asking land
A
One man throwing questions
       Dm
To the stars
A               C
Is there anyone there?

E        C
Carnival girl
A              Am         E      C  A  C
Where do those eyes come from?
E         C
What is inside there?
A       C       E  C  A  Am
So far away

Carnival girl
Where do our lives come from?
She'll keep on dancing
The night away
