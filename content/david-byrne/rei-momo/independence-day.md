F                  Bb A
Now and then I get horny
Gm
At night you do
F            A
At night you do
D      Gm7         Cm
Smile-from side to side
Gm
At night you do
F            A
At night you do

F             C                Bb
And she'll be comin' round the mountain
F              C             Bb
With six white horses by her side
Gm           D              E#
No stops for gas, food or lodging
Bb            F             E
She's wearing nothing but a smile
F             C                Bb
And though we struggle for our freedom
F             C            Bb
Our need for others still remains
Gm           D            E#
We know what will make us happy
Bb           F             E
We know what will ease our pain

We'll pretend we are married
Gm
At night we do
F           A
At night we do

Slide- your hand in mine
Gm
At night we do
F           A
At night we do

F         C               Bb
My bed is flyin' over the window
F                  C            Bb
I'm pullin' up my covers to the rain
Gm          D            E#
And down below cats are howlin'
Bb      F        E
It's a family affair--
F               C             Bb
They're selling vegetables on Broadway
F         C              Bb
A man is runnin' for the train
Gm        D         E#
Strollin' down 42nd Street
Bb      F           E
On our Independence Day
Gm    D       E#     
Rub-A-Dub on 57th Street

Arm in arm on 82nd Street

Hey Mister, Hey Lady
    D                       A
Hey sisters walkin' hand in hand
         D              A
We'll be lovers in the open
          D                     A
We'll be lovers on Independence Day
        D             A
Hand in hand, hand in hand
         D                   A
Hand in hand on Independence Day

F            C               Bb
This compass points in two directions
F              C                 Bb
And North and South are both the same
Gm          D             E#
We'll look forward to the good times
Bb        F           E
Come our Independence Day

And it's been such a long time
Such a long time, such a long time
And now it's here!

Waiting Such a long time
Such a long time, such a long time
Such a long time
Till Independence Day

Waiting such a long time
Such a long time, such a long time
Waiting Such a long time
Till Independence Day
Waiting Such a long time
Such a long time, such a long time
And now it's here!
