A probably better version was sent to me by Renie Plonski:

First riff is based in the Am chord

E |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
B |   |   |   | 5 |   |   | 8 |   |
G |   |   |   |   | 6 |   |   |   |

Play whole section 2 times:
G6, B5, B8 (2 x's)
G6, B5, B8, G6

Go into Am, Abm, Gm, then there's another little riff that is played,
but I can't transcribe at the moment (don't have axe in hand) - will get
back to you tomorrow with it.

(Play above riff)
Yeah we are the noise

(Play above riff)	Am, Abm, Gm
The noise between stations

Continue playing this riff/chords until next verse

G		     G, F#, F, Em
I walk like a building
              A
I never get wet
		G, F#, F, Em
Looking at ladies
		A
Talking like men

Bm		   F#m
Don't work for the city

G                   C
Don't work for the state

Bm		    F#m
It's none of your business

G		A
I'm doin' alright

D					G
Marchin' through the wildernes (Ba ba ba bum)
					A
Crying out for tender ness (ba ba ba bum)
				Bm
They call me mister pitiful but every thing is wonderful

Then back to the first riff/chords for the second half of the song.


When it gets near the end, where the chorus is played twice, the second
time it is played, just take the chords up a half step (D#, G#,Bb, Cm)

THANKS RENIE!
