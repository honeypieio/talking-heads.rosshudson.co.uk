Bm     G        Em       A
Little Girls go float upstream
Bm      G                  A
Some a' them never coming' back
Bm     G            Em      A
We are powerless to stop them
Bm      G      A  Bm  G        A
As they vanish...    from our sight...

Bm     G        Em     A
Little Boys dig tunnels
Bm       G            A
Into the ground they go
Bm          G     Em    A
Hundreds of them, disappear
Bm     G       A Bm G     A
Little soldiers...  on patrol

Underneath the floorboards
In between the walls
Ev'rywhere is filled with children
Say good-bye to Boys and Girls

"We promise to be better"
Said the folks at home
"But it really doesn't matter"
Said their daughters and their sons

Free from greed and hunger
Free from hate and war
Thousands of them altogether
We are here
And there they are
