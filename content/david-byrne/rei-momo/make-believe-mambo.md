It was a pretty picture
F         G
It almost made me cry
F        G
He's got Big imagination
F            G
It's better than real life

F           G
He can be a macho man
F           G
Now he's a game show host
F          G
One minute hilarious comedian
F           G
Now he's an undercover cop

Oh-- let the poor boy dream
F G                F   G
Oh-- livin' make believe
|:F   |G   :|
So how can we be strangers
He's go no personality
It's just a clever imitation
Of the people on TV

A line fro ev'ry situation
He's learnin' trivia and tricks
Havin' sex and eatin' cereal
Wearin' jeans and smokin' cigarettes now

Oh-- let the poor boy dream
Oh-- livin' make believe
Oh-- let the poor boy dream
Oh-- livin' make believe      (this verse twice)
