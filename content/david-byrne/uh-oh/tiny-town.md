It's a tiny town, you cabn hang around with me
It's a tiny town, and everybody knows what you've been doing
So don't you mess around, it's a tiny town
teeny weeny town, tiny town
And every little town, if you look around
it's a tiny town, tiny town

F             Em       F                G
Be careful my darling, what you say and do
    F             Em                       F    A
the shit that you make comes right back to you

        E          A          D          E       A    E
And the whole wide world is a tiny town, full of tiny ideas
          E    A             D     
with each tiny heart pumping up and down
E       A         E
Come be tiny with me

In such a tiny town, we have trouble living with each other
Someone would knock you down and someone else would like to steal your lover
Mmm, such a tiny town, it's enough to make you loose your mind
Mother nature said, she won't play that way so quit your crying

F          Em         F              G
Mama still loves you, when you go astray
F                 Em                F    A
You don't need to push her in her grave

      E     A           D           E        A      D
In my tiny mind you are tiny too and I'll be tiny tonight
         E    A       D        E           A         E             
For each tiny me is a tiny you, close your tiny town eyes

G                  D    G                      D    
And the birds sweatly singing in the tiny town trees
Bb     A        E                 G    Bb                   E
And the animals ask what you're doing, it's as plain as can be

F          Em            F            G
I see your sadness, like birds in the air
F          Em          F     A
I see them all flying away

        E    A             D          E    A    D
In each tiny heart in this tiny world is a tiny desire
         E    A            D          E          D         E
And each tiny boy and each tiny girl close their tiny town eyes
        E          A          D          E       D     E
And the whole wide world is a tiny town, full of tiny ideas
          E      A            D            E       D         E
with each tiny hearts pumping up and down, come be tiny with me



(this is what I think David Byrne is playing more or less.
Note that the original is played with a capo on the second fret.
I put the Bbmaj7 chord down here because I don't know the name of
the real thing:
