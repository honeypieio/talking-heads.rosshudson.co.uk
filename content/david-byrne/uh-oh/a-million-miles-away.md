G#              D#
Honey, come and dance with me
                     Bb           D#
'Cause I ain't gonna work here no more

|:D#   :|
I feel like I'm walkin' on air
I feel like I'm walkin' on air
G#              D#
I can see your house from here
                    Bb         D#
And I feel like I'm walkin' on air

You can't tell a man by his clothes
You can't tell a man by his clothes
  G#                  D#
A toad is a prince in someone's eyes
                     Bb         D#
And you can't tell a man by his clothes

(Rest is the same as above)

The stars gonna fall from the sky
The stars gonna fall from the sky
This time I think they've gone too far
And the stars gonna fall from the sky

Oh -- Oh --
A million miles away from here
And I ain't gonna work here no more

Oh -- Oh --
A million miles away from here
And I ain't gon' be treated this way

G#         D#
Some sunny day
G#             D#

G#                 D#
Gonna walk right on outa here
D#                Bb           D#
And I ain't gonna work here no more

(Again the bluesscheme in D#)

We must have been out of our minds
We must have been out of our minds
Your own back side will let you down
And we must have been out of our minds

Oh -- Oh --
A million miles away from here
And we must have been out of our minds

Oh -- Oh --
A million miles away from here
And I ain't gonna work here no more
A million miles away from here
And I ain't gonna work here no more
