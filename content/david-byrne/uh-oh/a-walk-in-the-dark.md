X                        Am
I'm taking all my little toys away
X                         Am
I'm taking everything you like to play with
X                         Am
The pretty colors and the shiny lights
X                     Am
do we just chase what we desire


B         Em     B       Em
Oh silent night, oh holy night
C   B         Em       C   B        Em
Sometimes you see me, sometimes you don't
Em  B      C        B      C       B           Em
You get to know me better, after a walk in the dark
Em  B       C       B      C            B           Em
The monster in the mirror, we'll take a walk in the dark
C B Em   C            B           Em
Ooh,     we'll take a walk in the dark

|:X   |Am   :|

I'm not afraid to close my eyes at night

I'm not afraid of what my dreams will show me

I saw a fish that had a human head

I saw some things that I would like to show yuo

A broken glass, the car's on fire

open the cages and set me free
Em  B         C        B   C           B           Em
My eyes have seen the glory, we take a walk in the dark
Em  B        C       B    C          B           Em
It ain't no bedtime story, we take a walk in the dark
Em B   Em                       C
Ooh,   we'll take a walk in the dark (2x)
C Em C              Em
Ooh, who'll help me now
C         Em       B   C  B        Em
Surrender my love, let it all come down
B    C B  Em
Burn baby burn
         A      C            A    C
And now: Jesus, Mary and the Holy Ghost
A      C        A            C
Took a look and said they're lost
A       C               A      C
How the hell did we get out of here
A                C      A        C
They shook their pants, they got scared
   B  C      B       Em
So no matter who you are
C          B           Em
You need a walk in the dark
          C              B    Em
And every pretty thing I ever saw
C        B           Em
I took a walk in the dark
C B Em  C            B           Em
Ooh,    we'll take a walk in the dark
