Prime time in the living rooms
And now all the drapes are closed
Moonlight shinin' from above
(It) seems that ev'rybody knows (that)

Oh -- something ain't right
Oh -- something ain't right

Well, god can turn the world around
And he can push it in the dirt
And he can tear it all apart
And he don't care who all gets hurt

Oh -- something ain't right
Oh -- something ain't right

D
There's a place where money grows on trees
                                       A
Now the only way to reach it's on your knees

C'mon down -- you old fart
Let's see if you have got a heart
It ain't true -- it's all lies
Are you the devil in disguise?
Won't give up -- won't bow down
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down

Oh -- something ain't right
Oh -- something ain't right

{next verse cut from release:

Face to face -- man to man
I've seen the lord and you ain't him
It's our life -- it's our time
You don't care if we sink or swim

Oh -- something ain't right
Oh -- something ain't right

end cut}

Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star
                                  A
Who the hell now do you think you are?

A
Oh -- something ain't right
A
Oh -- something ain't right
|:A    D:|
Oh -- something ain't right
Oh -- something ain't right
