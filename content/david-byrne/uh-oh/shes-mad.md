Bangin' his head
Stab in the back
Look her in the eye and Buddy, you can tell she's crazy
Smack in the face
Look at 'em go
Take a look around and you can see I don't mean maybe

Fell on his back
Rubbin' his head
Pretty little girl; sure as hell she ain't no lady

I'm mild as a bunny
I'm meek as a lamb
You lead me to slaughter
I'm mud in your hands

Bit him in the hand and he turned around and hit her with a hammer
Flippity flop
When does it stop?
Here they come again
And that's the way they live together
