A little kitten she deserves a home

Tell you dudes when I get old enough

You bet that I am gonna try some stuff

Twisted sister
Don't 'cha miss her
There's a hundred more where she came from
Wiggle wiggle
Jiggle jiggle
D              A                Bm
Jesus, how the babes are almost grown!

            F#m               Bm           F#   Bm
And I don't need to watch the news at night
   F#m               Bm          A
Anyone can see we're out of time --

D       G
Hangin' on

Hangin' out

Got my hundred dollar shoes
        G
Hangin' round
        D
Hangin' free
           A               D
And we got nothin' else to do
          G
What goes up
          D
Must come down
        A           D
Oh, she took an overdose
        G
Hangin' out
        D
Hangin' free
         A             D
Till our mama takes us home

Shimmy shimmy
Gimmie gimmie
We don't need you and we don't need love
I gotta have it
I'm gonna grab it
It ain't stealing, hey, it's only fun

         F#m              Bm         F#m   Bm
When you live inside the pleasure dome
          F#m        Bm           A
You don't ever wanna go back home

D       G
Hangin' on
        D
Hangin' out
         A              D
Some are hangin' upside down
          G
A perfect world
          D
A perfect girl
        A                D
Oh -- another year rolls by
        G
I'm the king
              D
And you're my queen
           A            D
When those zombies all awake
         G
A broken heart
         D
A broken home
         A               D
Ain't no tears upon your face

Hangin' on
        D
Hangin' out
        A                D   
There's place for me and you
        G
Hangin' round
        D
Hangin' free
       A               D
We got nothin' else to do
        G
Turn it up
        D
Fade it down
           A                D
Yeah, that song it saved my life
        G
Perfect teeth
          D
A perfect smile
        A               D
Oh, she was a friend of mine
         G
Let's go out
       D
To the place
          A                  D
Where the hands of time are slowed
       G
No one walks
       D
No one dies
        A          D
No more hassles anymore
