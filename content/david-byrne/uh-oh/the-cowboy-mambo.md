I can't find my way around this table
    E       B       E     B         E    B  E  B
And I can't find my way around your face
    E       B       E    B          E    B   E   B
And I can't find my way around your body
    E       B        E    B      E       n.c.
And wasted days turn into wasted nights

Hey lookit me now!

Hey lookit me now now now now now now!

The future isn't quite what you imagined
Ev'rything you valued has been sold
And ev'ry heart that takes a chance is broken
Now I don't see you laughin' at us no more

Hey lookit you now!
Hey lookit you now!
Hey lookit you now now now now now now!
Lookit you now!

Green grass grows around the backyard shithouse
And that is where the sweetest flowers bloom
We are flowers growin' in God's garden
And that is why he spreads the shit around

Hey lookit us now!
Hey lookit us now!
Hey lookit us now now now now now now!
Lookit us now!

Hey lookit me now!
Hey lookit me now!
Hey lookit me now now now now now now!
Lookit me now!
