Now Washington, D.C.
     A     G      A     G
Is a funny little town
    A       G        A    G
The further you look into it
    A       G            A
The further things stick out

|:A   G  :|
You oughta be ashamed
You oughta be destroyed
I'll chop you into little bits
And feed you to my dogs

|:A   E  :|
Well well well well well
What have we got here?
What have we got now?
Hey hey hey hey hey
Twistin' in the wind
Twistin' all night long

|:C  G  :|
Now can you picture this?
A taste of what will be
The weatherman is wrong again
It looks like rain to me

I heard the whistle blow
The train has jumped the track
The mighty engine's outa gas
Bureaucratic heart attack

My sister likes the boys
They kinda like her, too
My mama says, "Be careful"
Sister says, "No, that ain't cool"

My daddy fell in love
Down at the factory
And me, I like to sit around
Get high, and watch T.V.

|:E  A  :|
Well well well well well
What have we got here?
What have we got now?
Hey hey hey hey hey
Twistin' in the wind
Twistin' all night long

Now I can take a joke
I'm laughin' at myself
I faked my way through college
And I faked my way through sex

|:C  G  :|
I've been falling down too long
I've been bangin' up my head
And if I could stay on my feet
I'd prob'ly go right back again

Now Harry's got a gun
And he just turned fourteen
He dresses like a gangster
But he's livin' on the street

They kicked him in the balls
They shaved off all his hair
They put a current through his head
And left him lyin' there

|:A  E  :|
Well well well well well
What have we got here?
What have we got now?
Hey hey hey hey hey
Twistin' in the wind
Twistin' all night long

They say that crime don't pay
The judge does not agree
'Cause if you got the money
He will surely set you free

I'll watch you burn in hell
I'll see you in your grave
I'd like to watch you suffer for
The evil that you made

Hi-dee hi-dee ho
What a funny clown
The fat man he fell off the wall
And he can't get up again

It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodnight
Whoever is the last one out
Well, please turn out the light
