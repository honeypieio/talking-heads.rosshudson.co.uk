F#m           Bm+6
Back from the war
F#m        Bm+6
Covered in red, white and blue
F#m       Bm+6
So here I am
F#m       Bm+6
But I got nowhere to go

|:F#m    :|
Heaven help you now
Heaven help you now

F#m
Monkey man
        Bm            F#m   Bm
This is not Garden of Eden
F#m
Take a look
         Bm               F#m     Bm A
Who will eat and who gets eaten?

Saturday night
I'm gettin' outa my head
Who's laughin' now
You should be runnin' my friend

F#m                (E)
Heaven help us now
F#m                (E)

Monkey man

D.N.A. and evolution
F#m
Slide on down
        Bm         F#m
Say goodbye civilization

|:F#m   Bm   :|

A                       D
A hundred miles an hour in my mind
A             E
And there you go
A                     D
Outa control into the promised land
A           E
And down we go

F#m
Monkey man
       Bm                F#m      Bm
Are we just some weird mutation?
F#m
Oh, my mind!
        Bm           F#m
Lead me not into temptation

(as above)

Like a snake
I will strike without a warnin'
Holy cow
Someone pinch me, am I dreamin'?

Monkey man
Let's get back to where we started
Slide on down
Evolution's goin' backwards

A million miles away from here
