He is a boy
You are a girl
And you will always stay that way
But there are people
In this world
Who'd like to change what nature made

Bm         G                   F#m G F#m
And if you take that decision
Bm             G                     F#m G A
Then they will make that incision -- down below

D
The birds and the bees
A
Are singin' for me
G
And this is the song I heard them singin'
D
Goin' tweedle dee dee
A
Tweedle dee dee
G                                           A
But I never heard a word they're tellin' me

|:E  G  :|
Oh little girl
Please understand
And listen to the words I say
I was your dad
Now I'm your mom
I hope you'll comprehend someday

Bm         G                   F#m G F#m
I didn't mean to confuse you
Bm             G                     F#m G A
And now I know that it's hard to understand

D
The birds and the bees
A
Are singin' for me
G
But I never heard a word they're sayin'
D
Goin' tweedle dee dee
A
Tweedle dee dee
G
Freedom of choice is what they're bringin'

And when Columbus sailed
Upon that mighty sea
Well, we are just like him
Yes, we are pioneers

Into the great unknown
The wild uncharted lands
There ain't no turning back
                            A
Ain't gonna be no chains on me

BREAK

A                 F#
Who would ever believe
A                 G#m
Caterpillars like me
G              E
Turning into a butterfly
F#                   A
Well, I was suddenly free

|:D   |A    |G    |    :|
The birds and the bees
Are singin' for me
And this is the song I heard them singin'
Tweedle dee dee
Tweedle dee dee
Freedom of choice is what they're bringin'

You know I'm man enough
Ain't gonna run and hide
My love is mighty tough
My love is mighty wild

I got a pair o' wings
And I'm gonna fly away
Too late to turn back now
Tomorrow came today -- for me
