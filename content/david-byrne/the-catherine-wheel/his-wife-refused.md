A great big house- with nothing in it
He comes home says "Now wait a minute"
He's comin' in She's goin' out
He turns around says, "What's that about?"

Do what they like, the kid's in school
Think she don't know, now, who's kidding who?
He turns around says "Who wants to know?"
Open the door and there's nobody home!

Go ahead- fill their heads
Go ahead- fill their heads with poison
Take a look- these people are savages!
Take a look- at their misfortune

I'm gonna wait till I close the door
I'm gonna wrap, myself in blankets
I'm gonna, roll out, across the floor

Well the bride  bride and the groom
Run in a circle around their house
They're goin' out they're comin' in
Inside a circle around their house

These shoes don't fit- this tie don't match
I'm gonna throw it away when I get home.
I'm turned around I'm doin' my best
I'm gonna wait until the light comes on.

Yes he's the king and she's the queen
Run in a circle around their house.
Open the door and let them in
Inside a circle around their house.
