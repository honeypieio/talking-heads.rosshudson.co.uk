Well it ain't my fault
My fault that things gone wrong
And it ain't my fault,
Some things are sticking out.
My big hands
Keep my big hand to myself.
Tip toe too
Tip toe around the house

G             F
Come, Come on in
     C                  F
It's not, it's not like that
G             F
Down, down we go
     C                          F
Fall through, fall through the cracks.

Well I help myself
Help myself to what I want.
Side by side
Get stupid in the dark.
Didn't get home
Things broke down
No sense
Not at all.

Come, Come on in
It's not, it's not like that
Down, down we go
Fall through, fall through the cracks.
