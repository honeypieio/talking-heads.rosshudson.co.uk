             Bm           F#m
The words of love are not enough
                Bm                F#m
Though sweet as wine, as thick as blood
            G                  A
Passionless moments and we are homeless
           D      A
Out on the street

            Bm                     F#m
But life is cool and things aren't bad
            Bm                  F#m
Got what he wants, lost what he had
          G                   A                    D    A
He's soon adjusted and got accustomed to these new ways


D     Gm               D
Blame God, how can you loose
Gm           D     Gm         A
Singing such sweet rhythm and blues
D       Gm     A          D
Strange days, she said to me
Gm       D                      A     Asus4
Being in love don't mean you're free


          Bm                   F#m
But night reveals what daytime hides
            Bm             F#m
Who lingers on, who sleeps outside
            G                     A
The soft seduction, the strong attraction
              D   A
Somewhere downtown


           Bm               F#m
A junkie's song, a dancer's knees
            Bm                   F#m
The laws of chance strange as it seems
          G                   A              D   A
Take us exactly where we most likely need to be

|:D Gm  |   D  |Gm  D  |   A  :|

           Bm               F#m
A junkie's song, a dancer's knees
            Bm                   F#m
The laws of chance strange as it seems
          G                   A              D   A
Take us exactly where we most likely need to be

Ah-aah
