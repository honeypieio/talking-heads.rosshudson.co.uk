I'm taking back the knowledge
I'm taking back the gentleness
I'm taking back the ritual
I'm giving in to sweetness

Come on preacherman, shoot me with your poisoned arrow
But I dance on vaseline
And I'm tripping out working on a revolution
Don't let the music in

|:E   |F   :|
I'm taking back the children
I'm taking back the ceremony
I'm taking back my offerings
I'm taking back what you told me

|:E7   |F   :|
You're dangerous, shoot me with your poisoned arrow
But I dance on vaseline
And I'm slipping out I'm working on a revolution
Don't let the music in

|:E   |F   :|
And war is all around us
Your gods are dead and buried underground
I was a silly puddy (?)
Your big ideas are useless to me now

My baby saw the future
She doesn't wanna live here anymore
Its lousy science-fiction
It's on your skin and seeks into your bones

|:E7   |F   :|
Come on preacherman, shoot me with your poisoned arrow
But I dance on vaseline
And I'm tripping out working on a revolution
Don't let day begin

You're dangerous, shoot me with your poisoned arrow
But I dance on vaseline
And I'm slipping out I'm working on a revolution
Don't let the music in

It started in Oklahoma
You always think it happened somewhere else
This madness is attractive
Until the day it happens to yourself

And our nights seem sexy
The checker in the cool clear line of dawn
The legislative body
And only once you're lost for my reason

|:E7   |F   :|
And I'm tripping out working on a revolution
Don't let the day begin
We'll turn you down time to time for evolution
Don't let the music in

And I'm tripping out working on a revolution
Don't let the day begin
We'll turn you down, make a time for evolution
Don't let the day begin
