I love America, her secret's safe with me
    E          A
And I know her wicked ways
    E               A
The parts you never see

F#m      E     F#m          A
Oh supergirl, you'll be my supermodel
F#m           E        F#m A
Although you have a reputation
F#m       E   F#m       A
Can I afford to move above my station
F#m         E              F#m  A
I'm not the only heart you conquered

And I love America, but boy can she be cruel
And I know how tall she is
without her platform shoes

|:F#m   |E    |F#m    |A   :|
Oh supergirl, you've been my supermodel
Although at times might I seem awkward
Don't run away, oh don't you recognize me
I'm not the only heart you conquered

|:E   |A   :|
And I kissed America, when she was fleesing me
She knows I understand that she needs to be free
And I miss America and sometimes she does too
And sometimes I think of her
When she is fucking you

Oh, America, yo siempre he confiado en ti

Oh supergirl you'll be my supermodel
Although your pants are 'round your anckles
And when you go, I'll be your dirty Harry
And we were just like in the movies

Oh supergirl, you'll be my supermodel
Although at times did it might seem awkward
Don't look away, I'll be your teenage fanclub
I'm not the only heart you conquered
