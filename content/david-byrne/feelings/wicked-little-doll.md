Wicked little doll, lovely to look at
Wicked little doll, charming to hold
Wicked little doll, you are not human
Wicked little doll, you have no soul

Wicked little doll, I'm not your victim
Wicked little doll, you need me too
Wicked little doll, I'll be your partner
Wicked little doll, can I play too?

Wicked little doll, collapsing beauties
Wicked little doll, cities in flames
Wicked little doll, devil or angel?
Wicked little doll, they're both the same

Wicked little doll, we're chained together
Wicked little doll, I'm just like you
Wicked little doll, it's human nature
Anyone can see you love me too

Wicked little doll, your perfect body
Anyone can see you're never wrong
And isn't it a world worth taking over?
There's a little doll in everyone
Make a little love, some parts are missing
Any little song that has will do
Wicked little doll, you speak my language,
Now I'll always be in love with you

Wicked little doll, Wicked little doll
