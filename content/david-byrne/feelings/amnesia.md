Peace on earth, soon we will be
F#            D       F#
Where nothing worries us
     D     F#          D
Lazy days, cool is the breeze
F#         D   F#
Across the universe

Bb                      D#m
Armies of soldiers are sleeping tonight
    B                          C#   D
And moonlight is kissing their eyes

|:F#   |D    :| |F#    |     |
When you awake you will be free
I'll be your lullaby

Alcohol, no need to fear
Rest in these fuzzy arms
Ease on down, amnesia
Baby's on valium


Keep us from danger and safe from our home (?)
From the wind and the rain and the fire

|:F#   |D    :| |F#    |     |
When you awake you will be free
And I'll be your lullaby

When you awake you will be free
And I'll be your lullaby
