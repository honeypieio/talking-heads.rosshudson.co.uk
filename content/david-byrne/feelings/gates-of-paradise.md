I am nothing like my sister
     A       G       D
I am nothing like my mom
          A      G     D
You can't see me in my father
        A         G      D
Oh then where did I come from

        G               A              D
And the laws of men are not the laws of heaven
       G                A               D
And an angels breath is like the desert wind
    G              A             D    A     Bm
And terrorists are acting out of love sweet love
   F#m       G    A
To bring us home again

|:A   |G   |D   :|
It's a sin to seek perfection
It's a sin to help the poor
It's a sin to hold conviction
For not if they're not true

(AS BEFORE)
And the laws of men are not the laws of heaven
And an angels breath is like the desert wind
And terrorists are acting out of love sweet love
To bring us home again

|:A   |G   |D   :|
Be aware of good intentions
And the passion in their eyes
For none of them can open
The gates of paradise
