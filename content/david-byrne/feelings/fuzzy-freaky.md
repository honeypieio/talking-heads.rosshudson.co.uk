E                   A
Roses tattooed in a perfect place
    Bbm       A                  E
She bears the burden of a pretty face
E                   A
The monkey boy, the leopard girl
    Bbm        A          E
The strange is also beautiful

G                        C        Bm
It's summer time and the grass is high
D             D#        E
Fuzzy freaky, funny family

E                     A
It's my body and I'll eat it too
   Bbm         A       E
To do whatever touches you
   E               A
My body speaks, my tongue cannot
   Bbm   A                         E
My belly rumbles but the words are stuck


G                        C         Bm
It's summer time and the weeds are high
D             D#         E
Fuzzy freaky, funny family


F#m E             F#m E
    All amplified, she scandalises [??]
F#m E
    And I'm changing size
    G            F#m
    Who was it?, jump on it
F#m E                 F#m E
    He's talking trash, and he can't get back
F#m E
    But he's meant to last
    G         F#m
    Inspired, desired
F#m E              F#m E
    I'm walking low, my grass has grown
F#m E
    And I won't stay down
    G        F#m
    Excited, delighted
|:F#m E      :|

E                     A
I'm awfully cute, I'm awfully cold
    Bbm       A                      E
I'm sometimes rich and I'm sometimes poor
E                  A
A butterfly when I graduated
       Bbm     A                    E
You'll have to stop me if I get too big

Stop me

G                        C         Bm
It's summer time and the weeds are high

Fuzzy funny, freaky family

|:F#m E      :| |G  F#m   |
F#m E               F#m E
    He's in reverse, he'll kiss himself
F#m E
    In perfect health
    G         F#m
    Inflated, x-rated
F#m E
    And I smell you now
F#m E
    In a haunted house
F#m E
    In a squeaky cell [??]
    G         F#m
    Inspired, desired
F#m E
    Now I'm wired [??] enough
F#m E
    And I'm almost grown
F#m E
    And I won't stay down
    G         F#m
    Somebody, somebody
|:F#m E      :| |G  F#m   |
    G         F#m
