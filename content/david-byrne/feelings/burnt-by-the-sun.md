Em                   C
Atom-smashers in the cocktail lounge tonight
Em                   C
Opera singers in the graveyard keeping time
        Em            C
And the DJ mixes them all
        Em                  C
And the music rhymes but it crawls
        Em               C
And the music comes from hydrogen bombs
Em                   C
Rock bands died when amateurs won
Em               C
Data in a hurry, using the new rubble
Em                     C
Wipe it up baby, gonna get yourself in trouble
        D            Em
We were burnt by the sun
       D            A
Having way too much fun
F                  C   Am
Sleepless downtown overload
D7                           B
Does the daylight bring you down?

Money pours down and it drowns the little man
Parking lot attendants stuff their pockets with their hands
And the children laugh in your face
They can see what you have erased
When dogs make love they don't look at themselves
Checking out each other by the way that they smell
Rubbing and a'scratching, itching all the time
Stop me if I talk too much, do another line

        D            Em
We were burnt by the sun
       D            A
Having way too much fun
F                     C    Am
The church of private enterprise
D7                         B
Did the daylight bring you down?

|:Em   |C   :|
I love salt, I love sweets
I know there's danger but I fall asleep
The curves, the gasps, the love of life
Headlines, ??gumbox, faceless paradise
Life rafts bobbing at the bottom of the pier
Wood bends faster if it's soaked in gasoline
All these towns look the same, everybody's clean
Roll 'em out, cheap and fast, kiss me when I fall

        D            Em
We were burnt by the sun
       D            A
Having way too much fun
F                  C   Am
Sleepless downtown overload
D7                     B
Did I stay outside too long?

Alcohol, razor-blades
All the clouds are miles away
Take me down, far away
Everyone's on holiday
Alcohol, razor-blades
All the clouds are miles away
Take me now, fly away
Everyone's on holiday
All the clouds are miles away
All the clouds are miles away
Everyone's on holiday
Everyone's on holiday
Everyone's on holiday
Everyone's on holiday
Everyone's on holiday
Everyone's on holiday
