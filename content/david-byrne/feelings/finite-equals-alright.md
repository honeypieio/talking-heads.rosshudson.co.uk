Bm                  E
Just thirty teeth inside of our heads
Bm                      E
These are the limits to our experience
     Bm  A          E  D
It's scary but it's alright
     Bm   E       A  D
And everything is finite

My - mind goes crazy when the taste is sweet
           Bm                E
Well we've known each other, eight years and twenty days
       Bm                E
