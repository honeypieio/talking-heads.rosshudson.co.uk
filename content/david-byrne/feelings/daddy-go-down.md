The sun sinks low in the western lands
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
And a woman's heart is like the wind
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down

And he could not put her from his mind
And love is strong and it will not die
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down

Protect me now from what I am
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
For I'm in too deep and I cannot swim
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down

And he cursed his hands and he cursed his tongue
For what he'd said, for what he'd done
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down

Love, love, love's obsession
What keeps a man alive
By some strange possession
I stay safe inside
My heart's on probation
It was my first time
In this world, world of wonders
Stick your head outside  |D   |

Now the ass can speak but he don't say much
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
His words of wisdom, come but once
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down

So build your house on solid ground
And stay indoors when the rain comes down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
Go down, daddy go-down, daddy oh daddy go-down
