C                                   G
You're looking at me but you can't see me
Am                         G
I'm Invisable to the naked eye
F                                D7
I'm a part of everything you are doing
                            G
I'm a part of you down deep inside
C                                    G
I'm the part that sings those gooffy lovesongs
Am                             G
I'm the part of you you can't control
F                                   D7
I'm the part that fucked up your promotion
                                    G
I'm the part that hurts when you're alone
        Em        Am           Em           D7
On this beautiful night by the bright disco light
        Dm             G#m          G
We will dance till the pain is all gone

C                            G
If love is alive why can't I touch it?
Am                              G
Does it feel like Jell-O or the fire?
F                                  D7
I can tell by the taste it was not poison
                              G
But it sure did mess up my insides
C                                   G
There's nothing else like you on my planet
Am                        G
You see me now in my true form
F                         D7
I did not come here in a spaceship
                           G
I came the moment you were born


         Em       Am           Em           D7
On this beautiful night by the bright disco light
        Dm             G#m         G
We will dance till the pain is all gone
