Em7
we're living in a dump
trying to figure out what sex we are
Am7
exchanging chromosomes
trying to bargain for a better future
          Em7
well i'll trade you my potential mental illness
for your bad teeth
Am7
how 'bout trading your sexy body for a full head of hair
        Em7
well we can't predict the future
but we're trying to to the best that we can
Am7
my cards are on the table i'm gambling everything that i am
Em7
and some of us are hoping
to end up with a perfect life
Am7
i'll trade you everything that i got
for the chance to be someone else
Em7
and what you see is what you get
and what you get is what you choose
Am7
and what i am
what you see
is exactly what i chose to be

C#m              E
and now we got a black market
   C#m               E
a market in designer genes
C#m                 E                C#m                   E
the most beautiful, most intelligent criminals you've ever seen
    C#M               E
and now you're paying top dollar
    C#m                      E
for what you used to get for free
        C#m                       E
they'll stun you with their looks
    C#m                       E  
and charm you with effortless ease

              C#m                E
they've taken everything from you
the way that you walk
C#m
the way that you smile
    E
the sound of your voice
           C#m  E
don't even know who you are
C#m
who are you now?
E
who are you now?
