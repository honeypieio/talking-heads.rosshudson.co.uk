we'll be the lights from an airplane at night

B

E

|:B   |E   :| repeat all the way through

isn't that the way-
it's supposed to be?
isn't that the way-
it's supposed to be?

i'm the look upon your face
the water on the lawn
the light from distant stars
the wreckage of a plane

the space between your teeth
the itch you cannot scratch
the mentally unfit
the pimple on your lip-

isn't that the way-
it's supposed to be?
isn't that the way-
it's supposed to be?

i'm the ice cube in your glass
a busted cadillac
the garden of delight
the joker in your deck

it ain't in what i feel
no, it ain't in what i say
and the pleasure of a kiss
it never fades away-

isn't that the way-
it's supposed to be?
isn't that the way-
it's supposed to be?

you & i
