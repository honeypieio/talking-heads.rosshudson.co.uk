(This song is either more complicated than it looks like or much
more simple than it sounds. There's this basis of Gm and Dm that
are played real short or are just not being played at all. Try to
do some improvising!!!)

momma she had complications
Gm                                 Dm
there's nothing very strange about that
Gm                            Dm
nuns said "we can't kill that baby
Gm                           Dm
we'll have to let the mother die"

Am                            Dm
we are all just lilies of the valley
                    Bb A
we neither reap nor sow
Dm
we need to get our hands a little dirty
                          Bb A
to make our gardens grow, hey hey

|:Gm   |Dm   :|
Gm                          Dm
way too many people on this island
Gm                              Dm
getting way too crowded on this boat
Gm                        Dm
need someone to bail some water
Gm                             Dm
if we're gonna keep this thing afloat


Dm
i like a little sugar in my coffee
                        A Bb
i don't mean sweet 'n' low
Dm
you don't know what you want until you find it
                          Bb A
i believe you'll tell me so

i need a little water in my garden
Gm                             Dm
i need a little sunlight on my heads
Gm                              Dm
i need someone to cover me with kisses
Gm                     Dm
when i'm all alone and scared

Dm
we are all just lilies of the valley
                      Bb A
we neither reap nor sow
Dm            
we need to get our hands a little dirty
                        Bb A
to make our gardens grow
