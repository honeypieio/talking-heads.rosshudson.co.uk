           Bb                Dm
And in the land where I grew up
          Bb           Dm
Into the bossom of technology
           Bb           Dm
I kept my feelings to myself
          A7               |D(+4)  Dm:|
until the perfect moment comes

              Bb                Dm
Then in your bloodstream I will go
         Bb         Dm
Until I turn into a part of you
            Bb            Dm
Heading the gardens of delight
           A7              D
That was a long long time ago
           A7              D
That was a long long time ago

             Bb            Dm
It's not the ending of the world
             Bb           Dm
It's not the closing of a discothque
          Bb               Dm
I used to go three times a week
           A7             Dm
that was a long long time ago
                 A7             D
yeah, that was a long long time ago

         Bb               Dm
And that roaring that you hear
           Bb                   Dm
Is only the blood that circles constantly
        Bb              Dm
no it's not applause my dear
               A7             Dm
no, that was a long long time ago

Dm
oh__ooh

           Bb             Dm
In between stations I can hear
  Bb           Dm
a million possibilities
              Bb             Dm
It's only the singing of the stars

                  A7             D
that burned out a long long time ago
                  A7             D
that burned out a long long time ago

Ooh, oh ooh
