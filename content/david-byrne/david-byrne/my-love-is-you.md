some men desire a princess
and others lust for a temptress
well i don't need one of those
'cause
my love is you
my love is you

some men replace their mamas
and some want a young baiana
i have no use for those
'cause
my love is you
my love is you

sometimes dear
    A
you tell me i'm an asshole
 D                           E
sometimes you're an asshole too
D               A
even though we filled with imperfections
  D                       E
i don't think any less of you

my love for you

my love is you
my love is you
