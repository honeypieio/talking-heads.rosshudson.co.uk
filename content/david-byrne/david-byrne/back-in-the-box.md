(BASIC PART)
the sun shines on the living
the sun shines on the dead
the sun shines on you and me
wherever we lay ourt heads

the sun shines on the evil
the sun shines on the good
it doesn't favour righteousness
although you wish it would

   Bm C#m     D  C#m
oh johnny, oh johnny
    D    C#m   Bm
are you still awake?
   Bm C#m     D  C#m
oh johnny, oh johnny
    D    C#m   Bm
i'm terribly scared

(BASIC PART)
and now i need an oasis
a place to hide from the day
i'd like a little dark tiny room
where the music plays

maybe you just lost somebody
maybe the world has changed
the sun don't really care about that
it shines on anyway

   Bm C#m     D  C#m
oh johnny, oh johnny
    D    C#m   Bm
are you still awake?
   Bm C#m     D  C#m
oh johnny, oh johnny
    D    C#m   Bm
i'm terribly scared

|:Bm   :| (lays under the above riff)
i'm back in the box
back in the box
back in the box again
back in the box
back in the box
back in the box again

NO CHORD
and now love's terrifying
i cannot hide waht i want
you cannot hear me or see me now
when i go back in the box

|:Bm   :|
if i don't make no decisions
i won't make no mistakes
but through all those tiny holes
well the light's still getting in

(SECOND RIFF)
|:Bm   :| (lays under the above riff)
i'm going back in the box
back in the box
back in the box again
i'm going back in the box
back in the box
back in the box again
