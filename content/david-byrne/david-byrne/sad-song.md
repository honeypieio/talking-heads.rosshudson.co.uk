A                    Dm
you may think i look sad
A              Dm
but i am just sleeping
Gm             A
it's my facial expression
Gm            A
i'm probably dreaming

Dm
A                    Dm
would you like to be sad?
A                    Dm
would you like me to teach you?
Gm                        A
well, you can learn to be sad
Gm                         A
but you must practice like i do

|:Dm    |A     :|
Na na na, na na na na
|:Dm    |A     :|
A                  Dm
you must follow directions
A                           Dm
and learn it right from the start
Gm             A
there isn't a short cut
Gm                     A
it must come from your heart

(as above)
there are those who are happy
there are those who are wise
but it's the truly sad people
who get the most out of life

you may think i look sad
but i am just sleeping

i'm probably dreaming
