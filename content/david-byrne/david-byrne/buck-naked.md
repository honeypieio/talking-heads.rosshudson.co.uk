Running naked, down the state highway
runnin' naked, in the middle of the day
runnin' naked like a Tom Cat's behind
runnin' naked but the cat don't seem to mind

Give me your heart
I'll give you mine first
give me your time
I'll give you my trust

(and we're) buck naked now
like when we were born
when will we find out?
why does it take so long?

and we're buck naked now
and we're buck naked now
and we're buck naked now
in the eyes of the lord

runnin' naked like the day when I was born
we're all naked in the land where I come from
I'm a long way from New York city now
we're all naked when youturn us inside out

and we're buck naked now
we ain't got no clothes
bare assed for sure
in the eyes of God

naked in my heart
naked in my soul
well, how does it feel
does anybody know

(well we're) naked inside
you're naked too
well there's nothing to fear
and there's nothing wee can do

(and we're) buck naked now
buck naked now
buck naked now
in the eyes of the lord
