         C         Am
I met my love at a funeral
             C           Am
I'm tired of good-byes & burials

                  F
Of friends I have known
            G
some I just met
          F
standing around
                G                   |:C   |A   :|2x
it's hard to forget - now isn't it?

|:Dm   |A   :|2x

|:C   |Am   :|2x

        C          Am
the war started in Bethlehem
  C               Am
a quarrel between holy men

             F
rocket's red glare
              G
night without end
           F
burning my eyes
             G                     |:C   |A   :|
it's hard to forget - now isn't it?

|:Dm   |A   :|2x

|:C   |Am   :|2x

           C             Am
and if our cells are our destiny
             C         Am
I want to be free of biology

           F
you are my friend
                G
but I hurt you, too
          F
it is not what
              G
I intended to do

         C           Am
I saw my love by the restaurant
            C               Am
diggin' for home fries in a garbage can

            F
Ice cream & cake
            G
sweetness & light
            F
a bottle of wine
              G                  |:C   |A   :|
that would be nice - wouldn't it?
