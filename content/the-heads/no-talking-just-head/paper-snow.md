Pink confetti, shotgun wedding
Rocket secrets someone's shredding
Nineteenth floor.

Laundry ticket that exploded
Joust with Quaker pamphlet goaded
Into war.

Ankle deep we heroes amble
Ankel deep we wade
Ankel deep through someone else's
Ticker tape parade

Am
Softly, softly, softly
Falls papersnow
Softly, softly, softly
All of our works blow away

Petals fell on Petaluma
Till-receipt from Montezuma's
Burger Hut.

Every day a billion dollars
Fall as black and white blue-collars
Plough their rut.

Am
Softly, softly, softly
Falls papersnow
Softly, softly, softly
All of our works blow away

Jets folded from Wall Street Journal
Shoot down cartons care of Colonel's
Chicken Ranch

Kleenex where the guy's been cryin'
Goodbye note from girl who's flyin'
To new branch
Am
Softly, softly, softly
Falls papersnow
Softly, softly, softly
All of our works blow away

Letters that I'd meant to send you
To torpedo and up-end you
Sheet by sheet

Tore up all the beg and bitter
Add them to the drift of litter
On your street

Am
Softly, softly, softly
Falls papersnow
Softly, softly, softly
All of our works blow away
