Come to me, babe, but come facing away
Look back, you'll see me, it's a grownup at play.
You might be pretty, but I've seen it before
If that's all you've got, I don't need no more

Never mind never mind never mind never mind

You got me hooked, I admit it, it's true
But the hooks are liquid, I can slip 'em, they're goo.
And when you've lived long as me you'll know, too
Have all the meaning of a day at the zoo.

Then again, the zoo's a nice place to go.
After all, we both were born there, you know
Come on, honey, it's a nice, nice day trip
You can give that little boyfriend the slip.

Never mind never mind never mind never mind

I like the way you blush at a touch
I like it better if you don't blush too much
I like to listen and I like to look
But if you can't accommodate, I'm fine with a book

The days are short, now, but comedy is long
It doesn't matter much and nothing is wrong
Don't get me wrong, I like you and your dress
But we're both better off without all that stress.

Never mind never mind never mind never mind
Never mind never mind never mind never mind
