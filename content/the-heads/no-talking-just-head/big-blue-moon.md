Am
Another Saturday night
G
And she knows where she's goin'
F                        E
To that small corner bar
Am
On the far side of town
G
Folks call her Ol' Faithful
F                    E
'Cause she's always hangin' aroun'
Am         G
Dressed up shimmy-shammy
       F              E
In her sequins and pearls

F#m         G#m
Hey, there, Moon
           F#m
Blue, blue moon
        G#m
I'm all alone
           F#m
Blue, blue moon
                     E
Without a love of my own

|:Am   |G   |F   |E   :|
A 'Stoli' on ice
Makes everything just right
She laughs and chit-chats
With whoever's around
'I've been there - done that -
Have you heard the one about -?'
No one ever listens
And they don't hear the sound

F#m         G#m
Hey, there, Moon
           F#m
Blue, blue moon
         G#m
I'm all alone
            F#m
Blue, blue moon
                     E
Without a love of my own
|G   Am  |
E
Just looking for a friend
|G   Am  |
B
Someone to dance with me
G#m  D#m
A little romance
|D#m  E D#m|G#m
Cheek to cheek!
C#m D#m
Someone to hold
D#m E  C#m
And dance the night away

|:Am   |G   |F   |E   :|
'Tick-tock'
Goes the barroom clock
It's quarter past two
And the night's wearing thin
She salutes the happy couples
Bids them all fond 'Adieu!'
'Barman, make mine a double!
Cinderella, here, has lost her shoe!'

F#m         G#m
Hey, there, Moon
           F#m
Blue, blue moon
         G#m
I'm all alone
           F#m
Blue, blue moon
                     E
Without a love of my own

|G   Am  |
Em
'So, I'll make believe
|G  Am  |
B
Someone danced with me!'
|:Am   |G   |F   |E   :|
She used to sing, she used to cry
But, now
She doesn't even try
Because she knows the stars
- Those bright & shiny stars! -
Have all fallen, fallen from the sky

The moon is blue
The moon is blue
The moon is blue
The moon is blue
The moon is blue
