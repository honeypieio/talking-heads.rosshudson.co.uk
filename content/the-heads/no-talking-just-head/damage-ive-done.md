Am                 F              Am    F
There's buzzin' and ringin' in my ear
      Am                F       Am  F
And I wonder where do I go from here
    Am                  F
The moments missed, the tickin' of time
Am                      F
I suppose this life is mine, all mine
Am                       F                   Am     F
I remember a time when my mind was clean and clear.

I remember the color of your eyes changed from blue to black
My fingers twist in a fist behind your back
I crumbled and I cried
I look a long hard breath and died
I don't remember what I did
I don't remember what I said
I don't remember attackin'.
If I could bend the bands of time, if I could reel it in
And in the mirror, who is that lookin' back
And I'm scared of whoever this is livin' in my skin.

I'm sweatin' with a pillow over my face
Thinkin' back to exactly the time and place.
Darlin', it was all for you.
I believed all the things you said to me were true.
You know I love you to death, my dear, you know I do.
