Don't take my kindness for weakness
When I'm into every one of your secrets
And the way you treat a brain, I don't need this
Everything is fixed in a slow kiss!

I don't need to see you standin' there
I don't need to beware
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care...

Well, everything is fixed in the one hit
And I'll say it once again, that is show biz!

Don't take my kindness for weakness
When I'm on to every one of your secrets
When everything is fixed in the one hit
When I have to put up with your bullshit!
Just because I do not keep my mouth shut
Doesn't not mean I am a blood clot!

It's a plant life in our one-and-only world...
It's a plant life... I've been planted and I won't dance...
