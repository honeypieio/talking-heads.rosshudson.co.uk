Two love stories

She installed a video camera over her bed in the bedroom.
No more lonely nights. In a film she once saw, a girl was
fucked by a dog. So she went to the pet store - but felt
stupid - and came home with a goldfish in a plastic bag.
The fish's name is `SuperMan`. He would circle the bowl
world in five minutes.

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights

This is two love stories

She goes to bed with a lipstick and a box of chocolate.
She read in a book once that chocolate was good both
in you and on you for sexual pleasure. SuperMan
watches glossy-eyed, camera staring mute, blinking
encouragingly down at the big bed where she has fallen
asleep, fingers smeared with 'Kissing Red' and melted
chocolate - SuperMan and the remote control still in a
cramped grip.

Two love stories

For your birthday I'll give you scissors - shining, silver,
sharp! - to cut me open and step right in. You know I am
hot enough to keep you warm when winter comes. Oh, it
would suit you good, it would do you good. You can do
it, you've done it before! Take my milky white and make
yourself a coat. Cut me open and step right in. I'm sick of
being without you. Believe me, the pain means nothing.

Two love stories

Infected by your tongue when kissing, the I.V. love shock
that took me for a ride never ending. I guess I should have
known that needle'd been around. The disease of loving
you spread fast through the blood. I lost everything I had
for you. I lost everything I was for you. I used to have a
language. I used to have a name. I used to have a name

No more lonely nights... Now I have yours
No more lonely nights... Snakebite
No more lonely nights... Stabbing
No more lonely nights... Sex
I wanted to tell two love stories
One would be the story
The other
Would be the story
About love.
