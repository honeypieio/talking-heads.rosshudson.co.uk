And Charlie Chance
Gm        m+9 Dm F
Mocks castles in the air
Gm          Gm+9   m F
And - bang - romance
Gm       Gm+9 Dm      F
It rocks his cradles of despair

Only the lonely
Homely sentiment
Only the lonely
Only my detriment

Gm          Dm7        Gm
I not gonna see you anymore
Bb       C
And I am cryin'
Gm              Dm7        Gm
I don't want to see you anymore
Bb             C
But I might be lyin'

Miss Hard he hunts
Her sikhs will not suffice
Bad Batter bunts
Willy Meek speaks of self-sacrifice.
His muse sick, it pays
How much now cost is the balance
The musician prays
'Cause his touch now is lost as his talents

Gm            Dm         Gm
I'm not gonna see you anymore
Bb       C
And I am cryin'
Gm            Dm         Gm
I don't wanna see you anymore
Bb             C
But I might be lyin'
Gm    Dm7   Gm         Bb        Gm
No, I know. Oh! Now, I won't let go
Bb         Gm    Bb      C      D
Oh,      I know. I won't let you go

And Charlie Chance
Makes castles in the air
And - bang - romance
It breaks his cradles of despair

Only the lonely
Blowing leaves in the gusts
Only the lonely
Loathing leaves disgust

Gm            Dm      Gm
I don't wanna see you anymore
Bb
And I am cryin'
Gm            Dm         Gm
I don't wanna see you anymore
      Bb       C
But I might be lyin'
