They came from the second city
                           C#m6 C#m
Where the screams came unattached
                    C#m6 C#m
Addiction was the latest style
       E    F#              C#m
In the faces they could not match
                          C#m6 C#m
There was a blue beat playing
                    C#m6 C#m
On the radio left behind
                             C#m6 C#m
And a man selling lies as truth
       E   F#                 C#m
Like a king who was loved too much

                              C#m6 C#m
They made a mess of your only child
                         C#m6 C#m
Her innocence was not lost
                         C#m6 C#m
While the judge and jury took their dime
         E   F#             C#m
They counted the miles and laughed

|:C#m   |   C#m6 C#m :|

Make way for the way we are
The fever still burns though the king is gone

Fever comes to the innocent
It can make you mad and free
But you never find a scrap of love
       E          F#        C#m
If you don't wanna feel the heat

A million flames are lickin'
They lie like dogs at your feet
Waitin' for the words of wisdom
         E            F#           C#
From the mouths of the bittersweet

|:C#m   |   C#m6 C#m :|

In the valley of indiscretion
Where fear plays the piper's tune
The heroes are the ones who tell the truth
               E   F#                   C#m
And break the rules with the courage of love

|:C#m   |   C#m6 C#m :|
Make way for the way we are
E           F#     C#m
Fever still burns though the king is gone

Make way for the way we are
E           F#
The king is gone
C#m
But the fever lives on.
