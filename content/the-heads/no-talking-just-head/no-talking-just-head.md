NO TALKING JUST HEAD  The Heads

The basis of this song is the Bbm chord. I've you'd like to give the 
song a different touch you might try to follow the baseline as well:
|:Bbm  Fm  |D#  C#  :|
although that's not what they're playing...


|:Bbm   :|
Give 'em no hope
No tenderness
No holiness
No sensitivity
No love
No heart
No imagination
No compassion

No talking just head
I cannot be dead
I will be in your head
You will be on your knees
You'll be beggin' me, 'Please
Make it fucking stop'!

No peace of mind
No serenity
No mercy mild
No divinity
You will give them no quarter
No inspiration
Isolation

No talking just head
That's what I said
I will be in your head
And you'll be down on your knees
Beggin' me, `Please - '


F#                 F#
Sometimes I feel - sometimes I feel
               Bbm
        like a motherfuckingless child

|:Bbm7   :| (6th fret)
Grease it up good
Work it back and forth
You don't even know who I am
Think of the good things
Remember the bad
No illusions

No talking just head
I cannot be dead!
When you pull the switch
I will be in your head
Greasin' it up good.

No talking just head
You've been misled
I will be in your head
Workin' it back and forth
Like I knew that I would

No tenderness
No compassion
No sensitivity
No love
No holiness
No spirituality
No imagination
No heart
No divinity
No charity
No mercy
No hope
No karma
No devotion
No immorality
No soul

No talking just head
I cannot be dead!
I will be in your head
You will be down on your knees
And you'll be beggin' me, `Please
Make it fucking stop'!
